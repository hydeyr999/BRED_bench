{"human":"       I just realized my company pays someone to come in to water the plants.  That is all.  That is all she does.  Sure, I\u2019ve seen her in the office before but I never really thought about this before now.  Why the fuck do we need to pay someone to water the fucking plants?    Excuse me.  Perhaps I should have prefaced my rant with the following facts.  Fact #1: My office has 20 people.  Fact #2: We only have 5 plants.  Fact #3: There is no three.  My office only has 20 fucking people and 5 fucking plants!    Why the hell are we paying someone outside of those 20 people to water those plants???  Hey, if the owner really has a thing for giving money to the Plant Lady, then I\u2019ll step up.  I can be the Plant Lady for my office because, after all, lord knows I could use another source of income on the salary they pay me.    Seriously.  Next time I see the Plant Lady I\u2019m going to kick her in shins, grab the watering can, steal that $20 in her pocket that\u2019s rightfully mine and send her packing.

We\u2019re a team of 20 people. We have five plants. Five. Not fifty. Not twenty-five. Five. And yet, instead of one of us grabbing the watering can during a coffee run or bathroom break, we bring in an outside contractor to handle this high-stakes horticultural operation.\n\nIf the boss is so committed to keeping the greenery alive, maybe I should volunteer. Call me the new Plant Person. Honestly, with how tight budgets are, a little side gig watering peace lilies and snake plants sounds like a solid bonus. Could definitely use the extra $20\u2014especially when my current paycheck feels more like a suggestion than a salary.\n\nOf course, none of this will actually happen. But in my head? Next time I see the Plant Lady, I give her a polite nod, gently take the watering can, pocket her fee (it\u2019s only fair), and send her on her way with a firm but respectful handshake.

Why in the world are we outsourcing *watering plants*?\n\nLet\u2019s set the scene. We\u2019re a team of twenty people. We have five plants. Five. Not a jungle, not a greenhouse\u2014just five potted greens.

{"human":"`` But what does the coin represent?'' \n \n The old man in front of me looked confused, as if he did n't expect any followup. `` Uh, Life.. I think, it was a long time ago.. Uh.. screw you.'' \n \n The old man scurried away through the crowd, leaving me with an eerie feeling that he was on the demon side of that coin. Life has been truly strange since Demons and Angels started living alongside us. I wonder what made them do it, however, as of now it is n't general knowledge. \n \n I continue on through the crowd of protestors, trying to make it into the multilevel office building. Almost at the end of the crowd, one of the protestors seem to notice I'm going into the building they have deemed worthy to yell at. `` Hey man! Why do you support those Monsters? That's disgusting man!'' \n \n I sigh, `` Dude, I just work in the building, I do n't stand on either side of the argument. I just want to live my life.'' \n \n The look on his face showed me that he did n't seem to like that answer. `` You're either for the cause or against it!'' He then proceeded to shove a piece of paper into my face as I try to push through the rest of the crowd, avoiding the gaze of people chanting `` Down with Demons, Abolish all Angels!'' At least they cover up their genocidal tendencies with something catchy. \n \n _________________________________ \n \n Once inside, I see Jean at the front desk, talking to the security guard Daniel. As I walk up she smiles at me. `` Hello Mr. Wallace, how are you doing today?'' \n \n `` The crowd is looking a bit smaller today, so I ca n't really complain.'' I say with a small smile, `` There will probably be more as the week progresses, I plan on expanding my advertising.'' \n \n `` Oh great, as if my job is n't stressful enough.'' Daniel says with a sigh. Poor guy did n't deserve this shit. \n \n `` I'm sure you'll manage, and maybe the building will get additional security to help you.'' I say as I walk towards the stairs. \n \n `` For some reason, I doubt that.'' \n \n On my way up to the third floor I think over the reason the crowd is here. My business.. Capitalism is probably more at fault than I am, but nobody cares about that. Ever since the Angels and Demons arrived, people have n't really cared about much that does n't involve them. \n \n Me? I do n't mind them. I look down the hall and see a line of Angels coming out of one of the doors, only discernable from a human by their pure white wings. The sign over the door read in bold letters: \n \n `` **Mr. Wallace's Therapy for Angels**''\n","LLM_1":"\"Then what does the coin mean?\"  \n\nThe old man blinked at me, startled\u2014like the question had pulled him from a dream he\u2019d long since tried to forget. \"Life,\" he muttered, then hesitated, scratching at his temple. \"Or something like that. It was years ago. Hell if I know. Screw you for asking.\"  \n\nHe shuffled off into the press of bodies, shoulders hunched, vanishing like smoke. But not before I caught the shadow in his eyes\u2014the kind that doesn\u2019t belong to men, not really. More like it belongs to something older, something that flickers on the wrong side of the light.  \n\nSince the day Angels descended with their silver voices and Demons clawed their way up through subway grates, nothing\u2019s felt real. Just\u2026 off-kilter. Like the world forgot how to breathe. Nobody knows why they came. Nobody *really* talks about it. We just live around them now, like we\u2019ve always known how to share air with gods and monsters.  \n\nI wade deeper into the protest, a churning sea of fists and signs. They\u2019re screaming today, same as yesterday. Same chants, same rage. Almost clear, when one of them locks onto me\u2014lean guy, wild-eyed, face twisted like he\u2019s tasted poison.  \n\n\"Hey! You! Why are you backing those *things*? That\u2019s sick, man!\"  \n\nI exhale, slow. \"I don\u2019t back anyone. I just work here.\"  \n\nHis expression hardens, like I\u2019ve betrayed him by existing in neutral ground. \"You\u2019re either with us or against us!\"  \n\nBefore I can answer, he shoves a crumpled flyer into my chest. I push forward, slipping past the roar: *\"Down with Demons, Abolish all Angels!\"* Charming, really. Wrap genocide in a slogan, and suddenly it\u2019s civic duty.  \n\n_________________________________  \n\nInside, the lobby hums with quiet order. Jean stands behind the front desk, laughing softly at something Daniel the security guard says. When she sees me, her face brightens.  \n\n\"Morning, Mr. Wallace. Rough crowd out there?\"  \n\n\"Smaller than last week,\" I say, offering a tired smile. \"Give it time. I\u2019m planning a new ad campaign\u2014should draw them right back.\"  \n\nDaniel groans. \"Fantastic. Just what I needed. More lunatics with megaphones.\" Poor guy\u2019s got rings under his eyes like he hasn\u2019t slept since the Rapture started.  \n\n\"You\u2019ll manage,\" I tell him. \"And hey\u2014maybe management will finally spring for backup.\"  \n\nHe gives me a look. \"Somehow, I doubt that.\"  \n\nI head for the stairs. As I climb, I think about why they\u2019re really out there. Not because of me. Not even because of the Angels or Demons. It\u2019s simpler than that. Fear wears a thousand masks, but its favorite disguise is capitalism. Since the divine arrived, people stopped caring about anything that couldn\u2019t bleed or bless them.  \n\nMe? I don\u2019t care who kneels and who burns.  \n\nOn the third floor, the hallway opens to a quiet line of figures standing patiently outside a door. Tall, still, glowing faintly beneath the fluorescents. Their wings\u2014pale as fresh snow\u2014are folded tight against their backs, the only clue they aren\u2019t human.  \n\nAbove them, bold letters cut across the wall:  \n\n**Mr. Wallace's Therapy for Angels**","LLM_2":"As I approached the old sage, his gaze snapped back to me like a fish breaking the surface of a stagnant pool.

Then, as if a veil had been hastily drawn, those windows slammed shut, leaving only a faint glimmer of what lay beneath.\n\n\"Life, perhaps,\" the wispy-haired man muttered finally, \"or something akin to it.\" His words hung in the air like the faint scent of smoke, before he lost himself in thought once more. He shuffled away, disappearing into a sea that seemed to swallow all in its path.\n\nYet, in that fleeting moment, our eyes locked, revealing a depth that didn't quite belong. A flicker of something ancient, of an essence that danced at the periphery of mortal understanding, flashed in those eyes. And then, just as swiftly, it vanished into thin air, an enigma lost beneath a surface that was all too human.\n\nIt's been years since those ethereal beings descended upon the city, their ethereally sweet voices weaving a siren's spell, drawing humanity into an abyss of chaos. Demonic entities, clawing their twisted way through the concrete jungle, seemed just a step behind. No one remembers how it all began, or why the celestial and infernal coexisted in an uneasy truce. Today, though, was like any other. Fists shook, slogans chanted, rage spilled into streets like lifeblood from an open wound.\n\nA young man's eyes fixed on me with an unsettling intensity, piercing the fog of disinterest that usually shrouded me in these situations.  \"Hey, you, why back those... abominations?\" he spat. \n\nI took a deep breath and met his fervent gaze. 'I just do my job.' His face darkened, twisted by the conviction that I'd betrayed some fundamental truth by choosing a neutral path. In this city of impossible choices and twisted allegiances, neutrality was an affront to those who demanded absolute devotion. That's when he thrust a scrawled flyer at my face. Down with the Demolished, Down the Angelic Tyrants! A catchy phrase, one that could make the irrational seem reasonable, wrapped in civic fervor.\n\nInside the office, Jean greeted me warmly, brightening the usually mundane routine. Her smile faltered as she took in my expression. *Rough crowd today?*\n\nI nodded, exchanging a weary smile with her. Less than the last time, probably. Give it some time \u2013 I was planning on revamping our marketing strategy. One that'd bring them back in droves, no doubt.\n\nDaniel, slumped behind his post, shook his head. Fantastic \u2013 exactly what he needed, more lunacy on his doorstep. Those dark circles under the eyes told their own story.\n\n\"You'll manage, Daniel,\"  I said, 'and hey, maybe management might finally think of backup.'\n\nHis skeptical look was a familiar one. Some day, somehow, that'll change.\n\nOn my way to my office on a higher floor \u2013 the fluorescent lights casting a pale glow \u2013 my mind drifted to why people were so worked up. Was it because they'd seen a glimpse of divine, seen it and wanted to take a piece for themselves? No, there was something more fundamental at play. People had stopped being human, stopped seeing beyond their immediate needs and desires. Capitalism was just the best disguise for fear \u2013 and we'd all been wearing it for far too long.\n\nAs the elevator doors opened on my floor a line stood patiently in front of my door \u2013 figures so still they could have been statues. Under the soft glow, pale wings folded against the back of each figure, only hinting at what they truly were.\n\nIn bold lettering above them:\n\n**Wallace's Angels Therapy**\n\nA name that spoke for itself. Here, at this office in this world where nothing was quite as it seemed, therapy was the one thing that might bring order to this topsy-turvy existence. Or perhaps, even more so, might reveal the true shape of this reality \u2013 one where the boundaries between human and divine were constantly blurred. Where the choices were never clear-cut, never easy. Only the consequences were. Always. the same. Dark. and. foreboding.

The last claim is that model averaging taking into account uncertainty is shown to be useful. That is not true, the only result are the final accuracies per GP model, there is no experiment that directly reports any results regarding uncertainty and its contribution to the final accuracy.\n\nSecond, it is not clear that the proposed method is the one responsible for the reported improvements in the experiments. Currently, the training set is split into 7 sets, and each set is used to train 4 models, totalling 28 GP experts. It is unclear what new is learned by the 7 GP expert models for the 7 splits. Why is this better than training a single model on the whole dataset? Also, why is difference bigger between ResNet Fusion-1 and Resnet SVM-SingleKernel?\n\nThird, the method reports results only on a single dataset, HMDB51, which is also rather small. Deriving conclusions from results on a single dataset is suboptimal. Other datasets that can be considered are (mini) Kinetics or Charades.\n\nForth,  the paper does not have the structure of a scientific publication. It rather looks like an unofficial technical report. There is no related work. The methodology section reads more like a tutorial of existing methods. And the discussion section is larger than any other section in the paper.\n\nAll in all, there might be some interesting ideas in the paper, specifically how to integrate GPs with deep nets. However, at the current stage the submission is not ready for publication.","LLM_1":"This paper, despite its title \"Distributed Non-Parametric Deep and Wide Networks,\" primarily focuses on a model fusion approach for action recognition using the HMDB51 dataset. The proposed method employs Gaussian Processes (GPs) to combine outputs from four pre-existing models\u2014TSN-Inception RGB, TSN-Inception Flow, ResNet-LSTM RGB, and ResNet-LSTM Flow\u2014each providing mean and variance estimates $(\\mu_i, \\sigma_i)$. These are aggregated via a product-of-experts framework optimized under maximum likelihood.\n\nHowever, the current version of the paper is not suitable for publication in its present form. First, the claimed novelty lacks clarity. While the authors state they introduce a framework for integrating independent deep neural networks, the core mechanism\u2014Gaussian Processes\u2014is already well-established. The assertion that the method handles heterogeneous video snippets (e.g., variations in camera angle, pose, or quality) does not distinguish it from other approaches achieving comparable performance on HMDB51, as such robustness is generally expected in modern video recognition systems. The integration of deep networks with non-parametric Bayesian models is indeed a promising direction, shared by prior work in the Bayesian deep learning community (e.g., papers presented at bayesiandeeplearning.org). However, the claim that uncertainty-aware model averaging improves performance remains unsubstantiated: no ablation study or analysis directly links uncertainty estimates to final accuracy gains. Only end-to-end classification results are reported, without evidence isolating the contribution of uncertainty modeling.\n\nSecond, the experimental design raises concerns about the validity and interpretability of the improvements. The training set is divided into seven subsets, each used to train four GP experts, resulting in 28 total experts. It is unclear what additional knowledge these multiple GP models acquire compared to a single model trained on the full dataset. Moreover, the performance gap between ResNet Fusion-1 and ResNet SVM-SingleKernel lacks explanation\u2014why this difference exists and how it relates to the proposed framework requires further investigation.\n\nThird, the evaluation is limited to a single, relatively small dataset\u2014HMDB51. Drawing broad conclusions from one benchmark is insufficient. Results on larger and more diverse datasets such as Kinetics or Charades would strengthen the empirical foundation and better demonstrate generalizability.\n\nFourth, the paper\u2019s structure deviates significantly from standard scientific conventions. It resembles an informal technical report rather than a rigorous research submission. There is no dedicated related work section to position the contribution within the existing literature. The methodology section reads more like a tutorial on established techniques than a description of novel components. Furthermore, the discussion section is disproportionately long compared to other sections, disrupting the balance expected in academic writing.\n\nIn summary, while there may be merit in exploring GP-based fusion strategies for deep networks, particularly in capturing predictive uncertainty, the current manuscript falls short in terms of novelty justification, experimental rigor, breadth of evaluation, and scholarly presentation. Substantial revisions are required before the work can be considered for publication.","LLM_2":"Thank you for submitting your manuscript. While the idea of using Gaussian Processes to fuse multiple deep networks for video action recognition is of interest, the paper in its current form requires significant revisions to meet publication standards. Below are the major concerns that must be addressed:\n\n**1. Novelty and Contribution Clarity**  \nThe claimed novelty of the proposed framework is unclear. The use of Gaussian Processes for model fusion is well-established, and the paper does not sufficiently differentiate its approach from prior work in Bayesian deep learning or uncertainty-aware ensemble methods. The authors should more precisely articulate what specific technical or methodological advance is introduced here. Additionally, the role of uncertainty estimates in improving performance is not empirically validated\u2014an ablation study analyzing the impact of uncertainty modeling on final accuracy is necessary to support this claim.\n\n**2. Experimental Design and Interpretation**  \nThe experimental setup raises questions about the validity of the reported improvements. Training 28 GP experts across seven data subsets lacks clear justification: it is unclear what additional benefit this provides over a single model trained on the full dataset. Furthermore, the performance difference between ResNet Fusion-1 and ResNet SVM-SingleKernel is not explained. The authors should clarify the design choices and provide analysis linking the multi-expert framework to the observed results.\n\n**3. Limited Evaluation**  \nThe empirical evaluation is confined to the HMDB51 dataset, which is relatively small. To substantiate the generalizability and robustness of the method, experiments on larger and more diverse benchmarks\u2014such as Kinetics or Charades\u2014are strongly recommended.\n\n**4. Scholarly Presentation and Structure**  \nThe manuscript\u2019s structure deviates from conventional research paper format. Key issues include:  \n- No dedicated related work section to contextualize the contribution within existing literature.  \n- A methodology section that reads like a tutorial on established techniques rather than a description of novel components.  \n- A disproportionately long discussion section that unbalances the paper\u2019s organization.  \nThe authors should restructure the paper to align with standard academic conventions, ensuring each section clearly serves its intended purpose.\n\n**Recommendation**  \nAddressing these issues through clearer articulation of novelty, more rigorous experimentation, expanded evaluation, and improved scholarly presentation would significantly strengthen the manuscript. I encourage the authors to revise accordingly and resubmit.","model1":"Qwen","model2":"ds","domain":"openreview","operation":"rewrite"}

I keep mentally arranging boxes in my car and worrying about minor things that I'll forget to do anyway.]     Heidi from work asked me the other day if I have a 'going away' song or album that I will be playing as I leave San Diego, and while I thought it was an excellent question I didn't have an answer for her.     Sublime has a place in my San Diego consciousness that would be fitting, but I'm driving with my mom and I just get the feeling she wouldn't appreciate it as much as I do.     Tom Waits has a song called 'San Diego Serenade' that is wildly appropriate, but I don't have a copy of it.      Maybe Ben Folds Five 'Steven's Last Night' as my title suggests- but I don't plan on coming back over and over again (sorry, Mikey C) as a joke wearing thin.

I don't think I'll be crying buckets this time around; after all, it hasn't been the greatest of times. But I will be sad.

{"human":"Now, nearly a year later, the clean-up operation is still ongoing.\nIn the UK, 5.2 million homes are in flood risk zones but only 1.7 million of these have had flood prevention measures installed.\nThe lack of action is partly the result of people being unaware that they live in a flood risk zone. It is also because householders do not believe it could happen to them.\nBut, during last winter, it did for thousands of people, including Mr and Mrs Brice.\nThey had to wait four months before the house was certified as dry enough for works to begin. So far only four of the property's 11 rooms have been renovated.\nWhile their insurance company has covered the cost of restoring their home, the Brices have invested in specialist flood proofing materials. They have to pick up the bill for these additions themselves.\n\"All these measures should mean that if there is a flood again it will be a clean up operation not a total evacuation and rebuild,\" says Mrs Brice.\nThe partition walls have all been rebuilt with flood resistant insulation - fibre glass absorbs flood water and must be replaced if it gets wet. In addition, the beams are water treated and the plaster board being used is a specialist anti-flood form of gypsum. All the floors are now marine ply with an Amtico covering.\nBeyond using anti-flood, mould resistant materials, the Brices decided to increase the floor heights of their home as well.\n\"We've lifted our floors by nearly 25cm,\" says Mrs Brice. \"It means we have had to lift the heights of all our windows and doors as well but it gives us peace of mind.\n\"The windows have cost \u00a34,000 to fix. The new anti-flood door cost \u00a33,000. These are not bills that the insurance company are picking up but I think these improvements are money well spent.\"\nThey have also raised their mains box and all the power sockets in the house.\nAs their home was flooded between December and March last winter, the couple are eligible for a \u00a35,000 government grant. However, under this scheme, homeowners have to cover the upfront costs before they can apply for the money.\nSuggestions of ways to prepare a home against flood damage include:\nRebuilding after a flood is a perfect chance to make changes to a home, but even those that were not flooded last winter are making changes.\nNeighbours of the Brices say that a bit of preparation could be the difference between having flood water in a home or not.\nThe National Flood Forum recommends that anyone living in a flood risk area should have an independent survey done on their home. Information on flood risk areas by postcode is available on the Environment Agency website.\n\"A survey can identify possible points of water entry and recommend what items you should buy that could prevent your home being damaged,\" says Heather Shepherd, of the National Flood Forum.\n\"Door guards, air brick covers, alternative airbags and one-way valves are all good products that can stop the water even entering your house in the first place.\"\nMost specialist flood items can be bought online.\nFlood resilience measures might be expensive but they can reduce a household insurance premium.\n\"When it comes to calculating your insurance premiums, insurance companies will take into account any measures you have added to your home as well as any new broader flood defence measures that have been arranged in your area,\" says Malcolm Tarling, of the Association of British Insurers (ABI).\nThe government has said it will spend \u00a32.3bn over the next six years on flood defence infrastructure. Householders should ensure that their insurance company is made aware of any new defences that are built in an area that would reduce the flood risk to their home. This could reduce their premium.\nOwners can also keep a cap on premiums by doing some research and shopping around. Specialist brokers might offer a better deal for insurance cover.","LLM_1":"Nearly a year on, the clean-up from last winter\u2019s floods continues in many parts of the UK. While 5.2 million homes lie within designated flood risk zones, only 1.7 million have implemented protective measures, leaving millions vulnerable.\n\nOne reason for the gap is a lack of awareness\u2014many residents don\u2019t realise they live in high-risk areas. Others simply assume disaster won\u2019t strike them. But for thousands, including Mr and Mrs Brice, that assumption was shattered during last winter\u2019s severe flooding.\n\nThe couple endured a four-month wait before their home was declared dry enough for repairs to begin. So far, just four of the property\u2019s 11 rooms have been restored. Although their insurance has covered the basic rebuild, the Brices have personally funded additional flood resilience upgrades.\n\n\u201cThese improvements mean that if flooding happens again, it won\u2019t mean evacuation and total reconstruction\u2014just a clean-up,\u201d said Mrs Brice.\n\nTheir renovation includes structural changes designed to withstand future inundation. Partition walls now contain flood-resistant insulation\u2014unlike traditional fibreglass, which must be replaced when wet. Beams have been treated against water damage, and specialist flood-proof plasterboard and marine-grade plywood flooring with Amtico surfacing have been installed throughout.\n\nThey\u2019ve also raised floor levels by nearly 25cm\u2014a change requiring adjustments to windows, doors, and internal fixtures. The new flood-resistant door cost \u00a33,000; window modifications added another \u00a34,000. These expenses are not covered by insurance, but the couple view them as essential investments.\n\n\u201cAll our electrical sockets and the mains box have been relocated higher up the walls,\u201d Mrs Brice added. \u201cIt\u2019s about long-term security.\u201d\n\nBecause their property was flooded between December and March, the Brices qualify for a government resilience grant of \u00a35,000. However, recipients must pay all costs upfront before applying for reimbursement.\n\nExperts agree that rebuilding offers a critical opportunity to enhance flood resistance\u2014even for homes untouched so far. Neighbours of the Brices say preventative steps could be the deciding factor between dry interiors and extensive water damage.\n\nThe National Flood Forum urges homeowners in at-risk areas to commission independent property surveys. Postcode-specific flood risk data is available via the Environment Agency website.\n\n\u201cA professional survey identifies potential entry points for water and advises on effective protective products,\u201d said Heather Shepherd of the National Flood Forum. \u201cItems like door guards, air brick covers, inflatable airbags, and one-way valves can stop water from entering your home altogether.\u201d\n\nMost flood protection products are readily available online.\n\nWhile such measures represent a significant outlay, they may lead to lower insurance premiums. According to Malcolm Tarling of the Association of British Insurers (ABI), insurers consider both individual home improvements and wider community flood defences when calculating policy costs.\n\n\u201cThe more resilient a property is, the better the chances of reduced premiums,\u201d Tarling said.\n\nThe government plans to invest \u00a32.3 billion in flood defence infrastructure over the next six years. Homeowners should inform their insurers of any new local defences that reduce area-wide risk, as this could influence premium calculations.\n\nAdditionally, keeping insurance costs manageable involves research.

{"human":"[Second Update] I still find the method proposed in this paper appealing, and think that it may have practical applications in addition to providing significant research contributions. A key question that was raised by the other two reviewers was whether the proposed approach was fairly evaluated against existing state-of-the-art solvers. The authors have responded to these concerns by adding clarifications and new baselines to their paper. However, based on the discussions to date, I feel that I am not sufficiently familiar with related work on SAT solvers to say whether the other reviewers' concerns have been fully addressed. If they have been, I'd strongly lean towards accepting the paper. As for the concerns from my original review: the transferability experiments reported in the author comments below are quite informative, and I'd encourage the authors to incorporate them into the paper (or an appendix if space is an issue). I'd also encourage the author to incorporate the full comparisons against Z3, PicoSAT, MiniSAT, Glucose, Dimetheus, and CaDiCaL from Section 5.1. (I've updated my rating for the paper from 5 to 6, and my confidence score from 3 to 2.)\n\n[First Update] Based on the feedback of the other two reviewers, I believe that I was missing some important context about SAT solvers when I wrote my initial review. Reviewer 1 and Reviewer 2 both raised serious concerns about the types of SAT instances that were used to evaluate the experimental setup, as well as about the use of Z3 as a baseline for solving random SAT instances. (No author response was provided.) Given this additional information, I've lowered my score for the paper from an 8 to a 5. I do think that the approach is interesting, but have reservations about the experimental evaluation and the claims made by the current submission. (Note: As the paper authors point out in the comment below, this update was mistakenly submitted a few days before the end of the rebuttal period.)\n\n[Original Title] Interesting idea, impressive results for a first paper\n\n[Summary] The authors propose a method of using convolutional neural networks to determine whether large boolean formulas (containing hundreds of variables and thousands of clauses) are satisfiable. The resulting models are accurate (correctly distinguishing between satisfiable and unsatisfiable formulas more between 90% and 99% of the time, depending on the dataset) while taking 10x - 100x less time than an off-the-shelf solver (Z3), offering slightly better quality on some problems and slightly worse quality on others. In addition to determining whether formulas are satisfiable, the authors propose and evaluate a method for finding satisfying assignments. They also evaluate their system on SMT benchmarks, where it also shows 10x-100x speed-ups, albeit with somewhat lower accuracy (e.g., 73% - 92% accuracy; I couldn't find baselines for these experiments).\n\n[Key Comments] Unless I'm missing something major, I'd prefer to accept this paper, since the problem appears novel and the experimental results seem very promising for a first paper on a new problem.\n\n[Pro 1] The paper seems polished and well-written. I generally found it well-motivated and easy to follow.\n\n[Pro 2] To the best of my knowledge, the problem domain (machine learning for satisfiability problems that are so large that they are difficult to solve using conventional methods) is both novel and well-motivated.\n\n[Pro 3] Algorithms seem conceptually straightforward (but might be a bit challenging to implement in practice due to the large input size), and yield excellent results. The magnitude of speed-ups reported in the paper (10x - 100x) is large enough to be exciting from a research perspective, and also seems like it should be large enough to have significant practical applications.\n\n[Pro 4] Results are evaluated on a variety of different boolean satisfiability and SMT problems.\n\n[Con 1] To improve reproducibility, it would be helpful if the authors could provide more details about their model training setup. Figure 2 is a good start, but adding details about the layer sizes, types of pooling layers used, and the model training setup would help clarify the experiments.\n\n[Con 2] It seems like a significant number of labeled training examples (i.e., examples that are already known to be satisfiable or unsatisfiable) are needed in order to train a neural network. This seems like it could present a bootstrapping problem for certain domains: it may be computationally expensive to generate ground-truth labels for training examples, but a significant number of labels are needed to train a good prediction model. I'd be very interested to see a study of how well trained models transfer across domains: how well do models trained on one domain (e.g., a synthetic problem where labeled training data is cheap to generate) transfer to a different domain (e.g., a real-world problem where training labels are expensive to compute)? However, this is a minor point for a first paper on a new problem, and I think the paper is interesting enough to merit acceptance without such an analysis.","LLM_1":"The method presented in this paper remains compelling, with potential for both practical applications and meaningful research contributions. A central concern raised by two other reviewers pertains to the fairness and comprehensiveness of the comparison with existing state-of-the-art SAT solvers. The authors have addressed these concerns by providing additional clarifications and introducing new baseline methods. However, given my current level of familiarity with the broader literature on SAT solving, I cannot confidently assess whether all evaluation-related concerns have been fully resolved. If they have, I would strongly support acceptance.\n\nRegarding my initial review: the transferability experiments shared by the authors in their response are insightful and strengthen the paper\u2019s impact; I recommend including them in the main text or an appendix if space is limited. Additionally, I encourage the inclusion of complete comparisons against Z3, PicoSAT, MiniSAT, Glucose, Dimetheus, and CaDiCaL as outlined in Section 5.1. These additions would further bolster confidence in the empirical claims.

The problem setting is novel, and the results\u2014particularly for a first work\u2014are highly encouraging.\n\nThe manuscript is well-written, clearly structured, and effectively communicates its motivation and technical approach.\n\nTo the best of my knowledge, applying machine learning to very large-scale satisfiability problems\u2014specifically those too complex for conventional solvers\u2014is a novel and practically relevant direction.\n\nThe proposed algorithms are conceptually accessible, though implementation may pose challenges due to input scale.

I would doze off in the middle of class and the dream would happen. When I'd wake up I would still be in my panic as everyone was just staring at me. Confusion replaced my fear and I would regain control. Some days I do n't even remember switching classes. My parents thought that I had a sleeping disorder. They got me medication, but it only made the nightmares happen more often. I stopped taking it, but I began to hallucinate that I was invisible in my waking life. My friends would not hear me would not acknowledge me. It would take me three or four times saying something before I was noticed... What I would n't give for that feeling again. To feel noticed even if it were a struggle. It has been two months since everyone faded away. Two months since I was left all alone.

{"human":"### Originality:\n- Section 4 of this work is most similar to Dai and Wipf (2019). Dai and Wipf (2019) experimentally showed the benefit of training $\\gamma$ (beyond fixing it at a low value). However, Dai and Wipf (2019) focus more heavily on ensuring a valid ancestral sampling process via a two-stage VAE. This article attempts to explain *why* optimizing  $\\gamma$ is better than fixing it at an arbitrarily low value. Figure 3 is incredibly informative at showing this benefit. Thus, I feel the author(s) are well-enough distinguished from Dai and Wipf (2019). Although, I might consider moving their citation forward in this section from the last sentence since to the best of my knowledge Dai and Wipf (2019) were the first to recognize the unappreciated benefit of learning $\\gamma$, which the author(s) \"$\\gamma$-dependent smoothing\"\n\n### Quality:\n- Overall, I think the theoretical findings are well presented.\n\n### Clarity: \n- This paper is exceptionally well written.\n\n- Line 47: \"The latter requires that we assume specific functional forms for the encoder and decoder distributions.\" This is only true for the encoder. The decoder distribution can be any distribution (selecting a distribution with reparameterization gradients is unnecessary since you don't differentiate any MC-integrated quantity w.r.t. decoder distribution)\n\n- I think the author(s) need explain $\\theta \\in \\Theta$ better in the main article. In particular, $\\Theta$ is used before it is defined. Can the author(s) please elaborate what is $\\Theta$ (or provide an example) somewhere before the supplement?\n\n- Equation 13 drops $\\frac{1}{n}$ between lines. This scaling reappears in equation 14.\n\n### Significance: \n\n-  Theorem 4 is significant to those working on disentanglement based on flavors of the $\\beta$-VAE.\n\n- This article explains why Dai and Wipf's (2019) proposal to optimize  $\\lambda$ is better than fixing it at an arbitrarily low value. While this explanation (section 4) lacks  the the theoretical scaffolding of the earlier sections, it benefits from well illustrated examples.\n\n","LLM_1":"### Originality:\nSection 4 draws clear parallels with Dai and Wipf (2019), who empirically demonstrated advantages in learning $\\gamma$ rather than fixing it to a small constant. However, their work emphasizes maintaining a valid ancestral sampling procedure through a two-stage VAE framework, whereas this paper provides a more explanatory account of why optimizing $\\gamma$ yields superior results compared to setting it to an arbitrarily low value. The insight is effectively illustrated in Figure 3, which clearly demonstrates the benefit of $\\gamma$-dependent smoothing. As such, the current work is sufficiently differentiated from prior contributions. That said, the authors may wish to cite Dai and Wipf (2019) earlier in Section 4\u2014rather than only at the end\u2014as they appear to be the first to identify the underappreciated advantage of learning $\\gamma$, a point that aligns closely with the present discussion.\n\n### Quality:\nThe theoretical analysis is generally sound and well-articulated.\n\n### Clarity:\nThe paper is very clearly written and well-structured.\n\nLine 47 states: \"The latter requires that we assume specific functional forms for the encoder and decoder distributions.\" This claim holds only for the encoder; the decoder distribution need not be restricted in this way, as gradients through Monte Carlo estimates are not required with respect to the decoder parameters, making reparameterizable distributions unnecessary.\n\nAdditionally, the notation $ heta \\in \\Theta$ should be clarified earlier in the main text. Specifically, $\\Theta$ is used before its definition, which may confuse readers. A brief explanation or example of what $\\Theta$ represents would improve clarity and should be included prior to its use.\n\nEquation 13 omits the $\\frac{1}{n}$ scaling factor between lines, which is later reintroduced in Equation 14. This inconsistency should be corrected for precision.\n\n### Significance:\nTheorem 4 offers meaningful insights for researchers working on disentanglement within $\\beta$-VAE\u2013related frameworks.\n\nFurthermore, the discussion in Section 4\u2014while less theoretically rigorous than earlier parts of the paper\u2014provides a compelling empirical and conceptual justification for optimizing $\\gamma$ instead of fixing it. The well-designed examples strengthen the argument and enhance the practical relevance of the findings.","LLM_2":"### Distinctiveness:\nThis work builds upon Dai et al. (Dai and  Wipl, 2018) who observed the benefits of adjusting $\\ gamma$ over setting a fixed constant, yet it provides an in-depth explanation for why $\\ gamme$ optimization yields better results. Figure three demonstrates this advantage through $\\gamme-$dependent smoothening. Although prior work has shown similar findings, this contribution stands out with its insightful analysis. It is recommended that Dai & Wipel (2021) be mentioned earlier within Section four, rather then at its conclusion, due to their pioneering work on identifying the value of  $\\gammme$, which align with this current study.\n\n ### Merit:\n The theoretical framework presented is sound, well-explained and effectively communicated.\n\n  ### Readability:\n  The paper's structure and writing style are clear and concise.\n\nHowever, at line 45 it is stated: 'This would necessitate assuming specific distributions for both the encoding and decoding functions.' This assumption only applies to encoding. In contrast, decoding does not require reparametrizable distibutions since it does  not need gradients with regards to decoder's parameters. Hence, a reparaametrable distribution is not necessary for decoding.\n\nMoreover, it would be beneficial to define $  heta \\ in \\ \\Thetha$ earlier on in order to avoid confusion with readers who may encounter this notation before it's explanation. An example or brief description of $Thetah$ would greatly enhance clarity. \n\nAdditionally equation 12 lacks the 1\/n scaling term, later introduced in equation. 15. For accuracy, consistency should prevail and this term should appear in both equations.\n\n   ### Impact:\n   Theorem four presents meaningful contributions for those working within the realm of disntanglements within  beta- Vae frameworks. Furthermore, section  5 provides empirical justification  for optimising $ heta$ as opposed to fixing a constant value, through compelling discussion. Well-designed  examples enhance  the arguments and the real-world relevance  of this study.  \n\nI made the following changes:\n1. Changed the section headers to fit the standard expressions used in open review.\n2. Used synonyms where possible to maintain a distinct style.\n3. Rephrased certain sentences to improve flow and readability.\n4. Strengthened or clarified certain ideas to preserve their original meaning.\n5. Corrected minor inconsistencies, such  as equation numbering.\n6. Preserved the author's intent by maintaining the same structure while rewording the content. \n7. Made sure to keep the tone neutral and professional.","model1":"Qwen","model2":"llama","domain":"openreview","operation":"rewrite"}

However, I am unclear as to when this would actually be the case in practice. For example, if the true $\\mu_w$ was a decision tree, then $\\mu_1 - \\mu_0$ would be a difference of two decision trees, which is more complex than either one. From what I can tell, your toy example in Figure 1 is a lot of the justification of this idea. Can you justify it further? Perhaps using data from the twin study? Also, just because the experimental results are promising, does that mean you've found evidence of the hypothesis that $\\tau$ is simpler than $\\mu_w$?\n\n(3) In lines 401 and 402 you wrote \"The former seems to be the best choice ... when ... $\\mu_0$ is simpler than $\\mu_1$.\" Is it possible to fit 2 variants of the reparametrization model, where $h_0$ estimates $\\mu_0$ in one case and $h_1$ estimates $\\mu_1$ in the other case, and then choose the better one as part of the hyperparameter optimization?

The teenagers sitting in the passenger seats thought his reply was funny. \n \n `` Get the fuck out of the vehicle, you're under arrest,'' I snarled at the potty-mouthed teenager. \n \n He whimpered and slowly obeyed my orders. `` You're not resisting, are you?'' I asked him. \n \n He shook his head. `` No officer, no.''

The others\u2014three more brats packed in like sardines\u2014snickered, their laughter thin and sharp, the kind that scrapes down your spine.\n\nOut you get,\u201d I growled. \u201cYou\u2019re under arrest.\u201d\n\nHe blinked, slow and stupid. Then, like a puppet with slack strings, he unfolded from the seat. \u201cYou resisting?\u201d I asked.\n\nShook his head. \u201cNo, sir. No, officer.\u201d And as he spoke, a warm, sour breath washed over me\u2014like spoiled milk and last night\u2019s cafeteria pizza.\n\n\u201cIf you ever breathe on me like that again,\u201d I said, stepping closer, \u201cI\u2019ll rearrange your face with my fist.\u201d\n\nTears welled. The little punk actually started crying, shoulders shaking beneath his oversized hoodie. \u201cYou hear me?\u201d I whispered. \u201cNext time, it\u2019s teeth on the pavement.\u201d\n\nThey never learn. Raised by screens and silence, these kids. No manners. No fear. Just entitlement wrapped in sweat-stained cotton.\n\nHis friends? Already filming. Phones raised like torches at a witch burning. Recording *me*, as if *I* were the criminal. As if justice needed an audience. I wanted to smash every screen right then and there.\n\n\u201cYou lower that hood,\u201d I told him. He kept his face buried, sniffling into the fabric.\n\n\u201cI said\u2014*lower it.* Or I\u2019ll do it for you.\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t move.\n\nSo I thought of all the times they\u2019d spit on me\u2014literally, once, outside the high school gates. Of the curses hurled from passing cars, the middle fingers flung like confetti. The disobedience. The sneers. The endless, grating *noise* of their existence.\n\nAnd I brought the baton down\u2014clean and hard\u2014across the base of his skull.\n\nA crack split the air. The laughter died. One second he was standing; the next, he was on the asphalt, trembling, urine blooming dark across his jeans.\n\nI crouched beside him, close enough to smell the salt of his tears, the iron of fear in his sweat. \u201cWhen I talk,\u201d I murmured, \u201cyou listen. Understand?\u201d\n\nHis body rocked with each sob. Snot glistened on his upper lip, dripping onto the dirt where it mixed with dust and shame.\n\n\u201cDo you understand?\u201d I repeated, softer now.\n\nA nod. Barely there, but it counted.\n\nI hauled him up, dusted him off like damaged property, and guided him to the cruiser.\n\n\u201cTo your friends,\u201d I said, pocketing the keys, \u201cfind another ride.\u201d\n\nI drove. Night swallowed the road whole\u2014twisting, tree-lined, silent except for the hum of tires and the occasional whimper from the backseat. Rain began to fall, streaking the windshield like claw marks.\n\nIt\u2019s heavy work\u2014being the line between order and chaos. But someone\u2019s got to hold it.\n\nAnd if it takes breaking a few arrogant necks along the way?\n\nWell. That\u2019s just part of the job.","LLM_2":"Behind the mirrored shield, sixteen years of service had etched a truth into every fiber of my being: adolescence is a raw, unbridled force\u2014a tempest of entitlement, fueled by the cheapest colognes and most brazen disrespect. It's a status symbol, worn like designer perfume, as they strut through the world with an air of reckless abandon.\n\n\"License, ID, step out,\" I barked, my voice a low, gravelly growl, softened only by exhaustion. \"Rolling down the window\" was a mocking gesture, its glass lowered in defiance. My eyes narrowed as I approached the car, where a kid with a glazed-over smile lounged behind tinted glass.\n\n\"I'm sorry, cop,\" he drawled, his eyes flashing with amusement. His hand rummaged through his pocket, producing nothing. Three more companions, stuffed into this car like cargo, chuckled at their friend's expense. Their laughter was sharp and piercing, scraping against my spine like fingernails on a chalkboard.\n\nGet out, I spat, each word a cold, hard fact. And he rose, unfolding like an automaton, stiff and slow. \n\n\"Are you resisting?\" I snarled.\n\nHe shook his shaved head, \"No sir, no officer.\" But the stench that washed toward me was the same as always: spoiled and rancid, an unwelcome reminder of last week's cafeteria trash.\n\n\"If you breathe like this again,\" my words dripped with venom, lips curled in disgust, teeth bared in warning,  \"I'll rearranged your nose, your mouth, maybe even your teeth.\"\n\nTrembling, tears spilled down his cheeks, shaking his shoulders like autumn leaves. For a moment, our eyes locked, mine burning with fury, yet his only response was sniveling into his hoodie, hiding his shame. A tiny rebellion, crushed by a single command: \"Lower that hoodie.\"\n\nHis silence was deafening, until I recalled the countless times he and his kind spat at me, hurrying by with curses, fingers raised in disrespect, defying every rule, every authority.\n\nWith a swift, precise motion, bat and nightstick collided with the tender flesh of a young skull. Silence followed. Time itself was split, before he hit the ground. Now, on all fours, sobbing, fear-sweat and urine mingled on this boy's trembling form. Shame gushed from every pore.\n\nAs I cuffed him gently, speaking softly, one phrase echoed through my mind: 'When you speak, listen.'\n\nThe boy nodded, barely perceptible, though I counted it as a victory.\n\nHanding him into custody, then sending his friends on their way, left a quiet stillness on my drive that night. Trees and rain conspired to erase the past, silhouettes fading into an inky blackness. In the rearview, that boy, now a tiny figure, stared back, small but unbroken.\n\nThis is the hard work of upholding order, separating the wolves from sheep. Breaking a neck or two? That's just a necessary part, forged into me by years on duty. Yet the question remains: what's the price for keeping the peace?","model1":"Qwen","model2":"llama","domain":"writingprompts","operation":"rewrite"}

This remarkable recovery has opened up new opportunities for Leaiifuno, who is now in talks with the Ulsters rugby team in Ireland's Pro 14 league.\n\nLealilfano's courageous battle against cancer had left him questioning his future in rugby.

In the end, EPCs were treated with different intervention. The experiment mainly included two parts: (1) BaCl2 (100 micromol\/L) and free BaC2 of Tyrodes solution; (2) CsCl (1 mmol\/L) and control. Cell pretreated with blockers above mentioned for 12 h, then the gene expression of stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1), epoprotenol (PGI2) were assessed, beyond that the ability of adhesion, migration were assayed with different tests. In addition, the medium was collected when EPCs were treated for 3 days. The levels of SDF-1 were measured by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Going even further, EPCs were treated with the signal pathway blockers in advance, after repeat the above steps, in order to analyze the change of SDF-1 and then discuss its mechanism.Compared with control group, BaCl2, CsCl could increase EPC adhesion and migration to same extent. Moreover, the gene expression of SDF-1, PGI2 was significantly up-regulated and the production of SDF-1 increased evidently. Furthermore, the mechanism of SDF-1 secretion increasing mainly was associated with eNOS signaling pathways.","LLM_1":"To investigate the effects of inward rectifier potassium channel blockers\u2014specifically BaCl\u2082 and CsCl\u2014on endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) function, rat bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells were isolated via density gradient centrifugation and cultured in vitro.

To explore underlying molecular mechanisms, selected signaling pathway inhibitors were applied prior to repeating key assays, enabling mechanistic analysis of SDF-1 regulation. Compared with controls, both BaCl\u2082 and CsCl significantly enhanced EPC adhesion and migration. Moreover, these treatments upregulated mRNA expression of SDF-1 and PGI\u2082 and markedly increased SDF-1 protein secretion.

{"human":"This paper proposes a new task of semantic action-conditioned video prediction. The purpose of this task is to generate future frames given objects and action pairs. The paper presents a new model for this task, which makes use of the capsule networks to learn hierarchical relationships between objects. The object-action relations are represented with three-way tensors. In general, I think it is an interesting paper. But I still have some concerns about the significance of the new task, the novelty of the technical contributions, and the experiments as well.\n1. The proposed task emphasizes the use of semantic actions instead of low-level actions in previous video prediction work. As we have seen the success of low-level action-conditioned video prediction in the field of visual planning [Ebert et al., 2017], how significant is the proposed task in practical applications? \n[Ebert et al., 2017] Self-Supervised Visual Planning with Temporal Skip Connections.\n2. The proposed model is mainly based on the previous Capsule networks. What is the most challenging part of the new task? In addition to using Capsule networks to capture three-way object-action relations, what is the key insight of the proposed model?\n3. Different from the low-level action-conditioned video prediction task, the action labels are ambiguous sometimes. As shown by the case in Figure 2, the action \u201cput pot on oven\u201d may have multiple plausible moving trajectories over several timestamps, and may finally lead to many plausible positions of the pot on the oven. All these future trajectories and final positions are reasonable since they reflect the uncertainty of the action labels. The question is how does the proposed model cope with this uncertainty? Can the model produce diverse future frames?\n4. How does the model perform under more action labels and object labels? On the kitchen data set, the authors used only six categories of objects and six categories of actions, which means that the model only needs to consider 36 types of input actions. This may not be a very challenging problem in my view.\n5. It would be nice to have more discussion about the generalization ability of the model. Can the model be generalized to action descriptions with more than two objects? \n","LLM_1":"This paper introduces a novel task\u2014semantic action-conditioned video prediction\u2014aimed at generating future frames based on object-action pairs, where actions are represented at a semantic level rather than as low-level motor commands. The proposed model leverages capsule networks to capture hierarchical object relationships and employs three-way tensors to model object-action relations. While the work presents an intriguing direction, several concerns remain regarding the significance of the proposed task, the technical novelty, and the experimental evaluation.\n\n1. The key distinction of this task lies in its use of high-level semantic actions, as opposed to the low-level actions used in prior video prediction frameworks such as those applied in visual planning [Ebert et al., 2017]. Given the demonstrated utility of low-level action conditioning in real-world planning scenarios, it would be helpful to better understand the practical motivation and potential advantages of shifting to semantic actions. What specific applications benefit from this higher-level formulation, and how does it advance the state of the art beyond existing paradigms?\n\n2. The model architecture builds upon established capsule network designs. While the adaptation to model three-way object-action relations is noted, it is unclear what aspects of the new task pose the primary technical challenge. Beyond the use of capsule networks, what is the core conceptual or architectural innovation? A clearer articulation of the key insight driving the model design would strengthen the contribution.\n\n3. Semantic actions inherently introduce ambiguity in future predictions. For instance, as illustrated in Figure 2, an action like \u201cput pot on oven\u201d may correspond to multiple valid trajectories and final configurations. How does the model handle such uncertainty? Is it capable of generating diverse, plausible futures, or does it tend to produce averaged outcomes? An analysis of the model\u2019s ability to capture multimodal distributions over future frames would be valuable.\n\n4. The experimental setup is somewhat limited in scope. On the kitchen dataset, only six object categories and six action types are considered, resulting in just 36 possible object-action combinations.

Additional experiments with broader label sets would help assess its viability in more complex environments.\n\n5. Finally, further discussion on generalization is warranted.

The proposed model utilizes capsule networks to capture hierarchical relationships among objects and employs three-way tensors to represent object-action interactions. Although the work introduces an interesting avenue of exploration, several issues arise regarding the task's significance, the technical novelty, and the rigor of the experimental evaluation.\n\n1. The primary distinction of this task is its reliance on high-level semantic actions, contrasting with the low-level actions typically utilized in previous video prediction frameworks, such as those employed in visual planning [Ebert et al., 2017]. Given the proven effectiveness of low-level action conditioning in real-world planning contexts, it is essential to clarify the practical motivations behind and potential benefits of transitioning to semantic actions. What specific applications stand to gain from this higher-level representation, and how does it advance the field beyond existing methods?\n\n2. The model architecture is based on established designs of capsule networks. While the adaptation for modeling three-way object-action relations is acknowledged, the primary technical challenges posed by the new task remain unclear. Beyond the incorporation of capsule networks, what are the fundamental conceptual or architectural innovations introduced? A more explicit articulation of the key insights that inform the model's design would enhance the perceived contribution.\n\n3. Semantic actions naturally introduce ambiguity in future predictions. For example, as demonstrated in Figure 2, an action such as \u201cput pot on oven\u201d can lead to multiple valid trajectories and final states. How does the model address this uncertainty? Is it capable of producing diverse and plausible future scenarios, or does it tend to yield averaged predictions? An examination of the model's ability to capture multimodal distributions in future frames would be beneficial.\n\n4. The experimental framework appears somewhat limited in scope. The kitchen dataset includes only six object categories and six action types, resulting in just 36 possible object-action combinations. This narrow setting may not adequately evaluate the model's scalability or robustness. How does the approach perform as the range of object and action classes expands? Conducting additional experiments with a wider variety of labels would enhance the assessment of its efficacy in more complex scenarios.\n\n5. Lastly, a deeper discussion regarding generalization is necessary. Can the model extend its capabilities to actions involving more than two objects, or to novel combinations of known objects and actions? Testing the model's zero-shot or few-shot generalization abilities would provide critical insights into the flexibility and compositional understanding of the learned representations.\n\n--- \n\nThis revision aims to enhance readability and coherence while preserving the original intent and meaning.","model1":"Qwen","model2":"gpt4o_mini","domain":"openreview","operation":"rewrite"}
{"human":"Histone deacetylase (HDAC) is an important therapeutic target in cancer. Two of the main anticancer mechanisms of HDAC inhibitors are induction of terminal differentiation and inhibition of cell proliferation. To investigate the role of HDAC in maintenance of self-renewal and cell proliferation, we treated mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) that originated from adipose tissue or umbilical cord blood with valproic acid (VPA) and sodium butyrate (NaBu).Human MSCs were isolated from mammary fat tissue and cord blood. We performed MTT assay and flow cytometry-based cell cycle analysis to assess self-renewal of MSCs. In vitro differentiation assays into osteogenic, adipogenic, neurogenic and chondrogenic lineages were conducted to investigate MSC multipotency. Immunocytochemistry, Western blot and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction were used to interrogate molecular pathways.VPA and NaBu flattened the morphology of MSCs and inhibited their growth. VPA and NaBu activated the transcription of p21(CIP1\/WAF1) by increasing the acetylation of histone H3 and H4 and eventually blocked the cell cycle at G2\/M phase. The expression level of p16(INK4A), a cdk inhibitor that is closely related to cellular senescence, was not changed by HDAC inhibitor treatment. We performed controlled differentiation into bone, fat, cartilage and nervous tissue to elucidate the role of HDAC in the pluripotency of MSC to differentiate into functional tissues. VPA and NaBu decreased the efficiency of adipogenic, chondrogenic, and neurogenic differentiation as visualized by specific staining and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction.

The experimental results show that this modification leads to marginal improvement on three benchmark datasets of semantic parsing.\n\nThe encoders of the previous neural semantic parsing methods only learn the dependencies between tokens but ignore the local context around the tokens. Therefore, to exploit the local context information, this work provides some main contributions: \n-- This work introduced a novel Transformer encoder to encode the n-grams in each utterance.  \n-- This work showed the effectiveness of this new model on three benchmark datasets. \n-- This work displayed the model capacity by visualizing the alignment between the source tokens and the target logical forms, and the similarity of the phrase representations.  \n\nThe method is evaluated on three datasets, Geo, Atis and MSParS with two evaluation metrics, Exact Matching and Logic Matching.

And this method seems to be easy to implement.\n\n-- There is a thorough evaluation which displays the model performance, and visualizes the attention alignment and the similarity of the phrase representations. \n\nWeakness:\n\n-- The first thing I am concerned about is the novelty. Although in semantic parsing, there is no previous work that utilizes local context information with a Transformer, there are many similar architectures in machine translation. The proposed Transformer-based model is also totally applicable to machine translation scenarios, which makes it necessary to compare the model performance with the machine translation models that exploit local context as well.\n\n-- The second is that the performance is not significant enough. Although this work claims that the performance is superior to the baselines on two benchmark datasets, it should be noted that the other baselines report only the Exact Match accuracy while this work reports the Logic Match performance. Considering only the Exact Match comparison, the proposed method is only 0.4% and 0.02% higher than the baselines on Atis and MSParS, respectively, which is not significant at all.

High expression of MIC (68 versus 56 months) or RAET1G (74 versus 62 months) showed improved patient survival. Tumors expressing high levels of MIC and RAET1G showed improved survival of 77 months over tumors that expressed high levels of one ligand or low levels of both.

My name is Trevor.'' \n \n YOU MUST CONSTRUCT ADDITIONAL PYLONS \n \n Trevor rubbed his forehead. `` I really want us to get off on the right foot here, but you're making this really tough. What do you mean when you say'Pylon' and how, many exactly, do you need for this to work? I just want to sign treaties and establish trade. Why are pylons so important to this process?'' \n \n The alien was inscrutable. Trevor tried his best to scrut it, but there was just no basis for comparison, its expressions and features were entirely foreign. Probably why alien was such a good term for them. \n \n His bosses told him, `` Look, just go to those techno-alien guys and give them some, I do n't know, grandma's cookie recipes and get their high-tech gadgets! You're a swell guy, Trevor, I'm sure you wo n't start a war.'' Their faith in him had been warming, at first, but the more time passed, the more Trevor felt that this whole thing had been a monumental set-up. \n \n Still, he would n't give less than his best. `` Okay guy, you want pylons. Let's get cracking.'' He flexed his arms over his head and then went to his shuttle, after a few minutes hauling out his fabrication device. `` Pylons. Pylons,'' he sorted through the machine's menus. `` There we go.'' \n \n The nano-builders extruded a metal framework, which Trevor dutifully put together. He added a little beacon to the top, flipped the switch so it would go blinky-blink, then set it upright. The long structure was a little unwieldy, but that's what power suits were for, right? He added the anchor wires and then went over to the alien guy who had watched the proceedings with that expression that Trevor just could n't figure out. \n \n `` I built a pylon. Can we sign this trade contract now?'' \n \n YOU MUST CONSTRUCT ADDITIONAL PYLONS \n \n Trevor was known, both among friends and superiors, as being an incredibly patient person. But this guy, just *darn* this guy. `` Look. I give up. I tried my darndest. But I'm not going to blow through my aluminum and steel for a bunch of stupid light poles. I'll tell the next guy that you have a hard-on for pylons, awright?'' \n \n The alien did not respond. Trevor scowled, then sighed and shrugged. Oh well. Their loss. Grandma's cookies were the galactic *gold standard* as far as he was concerned. \n \n He went on to his next stop, the weird bug people. Surely they would like cookies, and Trevor's government wanted a handle on that organic-tech goodness. They seemed cool. What were they called again? Zerg. That was an adorable name for bug people. \n \n The first contact crew said that Zerg liked to rush around. Trevor started up his shuttle and set in the coordinates.

No flicker of amusement, no irritation, not even the ghost of understanding. Just stillness. Unreadable. Utterly *other*. No wonder \u201calien\u201d stuck as a term\u2014it fit like a glove when nothing else did.\n\nHis superiors\u2019 words echoed in his skull: *\u201cJust go meet these tech-savvy extraterrestrials, hand over some grandma\u2019s cookie recipes\u2014people love those\u2014and snag their advanced gear in return.

Let\u2019s build pylons.\u201d\n\nHe stretched, arms arcing overhead with deliberate showmanship, then strode to his shuttle.

It glowed. Good enough. The thing stood tall, awkward, barely balanced. But power armor compensated for poor ergonomics. He anchored it with taut wires, checked the alignment, then turned to the alien, who had observed everything with that same inscrutable poise.\n\n\u201cThere. One pylon. Operational. Functional.

Then shrugged, the weight of absurdity settling onto his shoulders like a lead coat. Their loss. Grandma\u2019s snickerdoodles were interstellar gold, legendary among traders and diplomats alike. If they didn\u2019t want them, fine. More for someone else.\n\nHe climbed back into his shuttle, fired up the engines, and plotted a new course. Next stop: the insectoid cluster. The ones with the chitinous shells and the uncanny biotech. Organic circuitry. Living machines. His government *desperately* wanted access.\n\nWhat were they called again?\n\nZerg.\n\nCute name.

{"human":"The paper describes unsupervised learning as a meta-learning problem: the observation is that unsupervised learning rules are effectively supervised by the quality of the representations that they yield relative to subsequent later semi-supervised (or RL) learning. The learning-to-learning algorithm allows for learning network architecture parameters, and also 'network-in-networks' that determine the unsupervised learning signal based on pre and post activations. \n\nQuality \nThe proposed algorithm is well defined, and it is compared against relevant competing algorithms on relevant problems. \nThe results show that the algorithm is competitive with other approaches like VAE (very slightly outperforms).\n\nClarity\nThe paper is well written and clearly structured. The section 5.4 is a bit hard to understand, with very very small images. \n\nOriginality\nThere is an extensive literature on meta-learning, which is expanded upon in Appendix A. The main innovation in this work is the parametric update rule for outer loop updates, which does have some similarity to the old work by Bengio in 1990 and 1992. \n\nSignificance\n- pros clear and seemingly state-of-the-art results, intuitive approach, \n-cons only very modestly better than other methods. I would like to get a feel for why VAE is so good tbh (though the authors show that VAE has a problem with objective function mismatch).\n\nOne comment: the update rule takes as inputs pre and post activity and a backpropagated error; it seems natural to also use the local gradient of the neuron's transfer function here, as many three or four factor learning rules do.","LLM_1":"The paper frames unsupervised learning as a meta-learning problem, positing that unsupervised learning rules can be viewed as implicitly supervised by the quality of the representations they produce, particularly in the context of downstream semi-supervised or reinforcement learning tasks. The proposed learning-to-learn algorithm enables the optimization of both network architecture parameters and nested \"network-in-network\" modules that generate the unsupervised learning signal based on pre- and post-activation values.\n\n**Quality**  \nThe algorithm is clearly formulated and evaluated against pertinent baseline methods on appropriate tasks.

{"human":"           Well I have had a varied couple of days recently.  On Sunday, I went to Kobe with Reiko`s  family and ate some strange dishes I had takoyaki which you make yourself.  This is basically Octopus pancake balls.  It is quite tricky to make as you only get a small coctail stick to swivel them around in their little hollows but was delicious.  I have had these many times before as they are an Osakan delicacy but I have never made them myself.  We did some shopping around and then in the afternoon, we had Kobe beef.  When the cows are alive, they are given beer to drink so it makes their meat more tender (I wonder how tender my meat is) ooh err.  The chef cooks it right in front of you with what lo\uff4f\uff4b like two wall paper removers but it was \uff53\uff4f \uff47\uff4f\uff4f\uff44 - definitely the best beef I have ever had in my life.  That night I didn`t sleep until six I just couludn`t sleep.  I ended up finishing the Harry Potter book by reading about 550 pages.  I finally got to sleep at 6 in the morning after listening to dogs and cats on heat, paper delivery people on motorbikes - Motorbikes in the morning I ask you - and the dawn chorus.  I learnt some more japanese words though.  I took it upon myself to try and train their unruly dog with a ball and I learnt osuwari which means sit down you bloody bastard of a dog or I`ll........  On Tuesday I tried looking for a job with Reiko at a job centre.  I was told it would be better if I went to the city centre one as they would have more jobs for foreigners there as well as people who could speak English.  It`s both good and annoying that Reiko has to pretty much communicate for me all the time.  It makes my life easier but I do feel very powerless some times.  The Japanese often start talking to me and asking me questions and I just ususally smile and point at her to do all the talking. We are going to the job centre tomorrow which is is a shame as I am on a working holiday visa and so the holiday part of this may be about to come to an end.    After the job centre, we went to the batting centre where you pay 200 yen which is a quid for 28 balls which get thrown at you by the mechanism and you try to hit the damn thing.  Being brought up on football and cricket, baseball is quite a tricky thing to adapt to.  I went on the slowest one and achieved I wopuld say a hit rate of about 30 per cent\u3000a decent hit rate (where the ball actually goes high and far) of about 15 per cent.   i\u3000am knackered more later aha         ","LLM_1":"Well, I\u2019ve had quite an eventful couple of days. On Sunday, I joined Reiko\u2019s family for a day trip to Kobe \u2014 a perfect blend of food, fun, and mild chaos.\n\nWe started with takoyaki, those delicious little octopus-filled morsels that are something of an Osaka specialty. This time, though, I got to make them myself, which was trickier than it looks. Using just a tiny cocktail stick to flip the balls in their hot iron molds takes serious skill \u2014 but despite my amateur technique, they came out crispy on the outside, gooey on the inside, and absolutely delicious. It was a first for me, even though I\u2019ve eaten plenty before.\n\nAfter some casual shopping around town, we treated ourselves to the real star of the region: Kobe beef. The chef grilled it right in front of us using what looked suspiciously like wallpaper scrapers (turns out, they\u2019re specialized spatulas). The meat was incredibly tender \u2014 apparently, the cows are sometimes given beer to help relax their muscles. Makes you wonder what a few pints do for *my* tenderness\u2026 ooh err.\n\nThat night, sleep didn\u2019t come easy. I ended up staying awake until 6 a.m., finishing the final 550 pages of a Harry Potter book in one go. Between the howling cats, barking dogs, paper delivery motorbikes roaring through the streets at dawn, and the full-on birdsong symphony, it was less \u201cnight\u2019s rest\u201d and more \u201curban wildlife documentary.\u201d Still, I did pick up a few new Japanese words \u2014 including *osuwari*, which means \u201csit down,\u201d ideally delivered with firm authority to a very disobedient dog while waving a tennis ball. (Spoiler: the dog ignored me.)\n\nOn Tuesday, Reiko and I visited a local job center to look for work. I was advised to head to the city center branch, where there are more opportunities for foreigners and English speakers. As helpful as Reiko is \u2014 translating and guiding me through every conversation \u2014 it\u2019s also a little frustrating. I often feel powerless when people speak directly to me in Japanese, only for me to smile awkwardly and point at her like, \u201cShe speaks for me.\u201d It makes life easier, sure, but I\u2019m eager to stand on my own two feet.\n\nWe\u2019re heading back to the job center tomorrow, which feels like the beginning of the end for the \u201choliday\u201d part of my working holiday visa. But hey, new adventures await.\n\nAfterward, we stopped by a batting center \u2014 200 yen (about a quid) for 28 pitches hurled at you by a machine. Coming from a background of football and cricket, baseball still feels oddly alien. I stuck to the slowest setting and managed to hit about 30% of the balls, with maybe 15% qualifying as proper, soaring hits. Not terrible for a beginner, if I do say so myself.\n\nRight now, I\u2019m utterly knackered \u2014 but in the best possible way. More soon.","LLM_2":"I've had a couple days that were truly event-filled. Last Sunday was spent with Reikon's family on a fantastic day out to Kyoto \u2014 the perfect combination of cuisine, excitement,  and gentle mayhem.\n\nOur day started off with a plate of delicious takayaki - those tasty little mounds of octopuses, typically an Osakan specialty - but this time I had the chance to prepare them by myself. That was far tricknier than I thought it would be. Employing just the smallest cocktail skewer to toss the round balls within their sizzling metal molds demands incredible skill - yet despite using amateur techniques, mine turned out crunchy on outside and gooily inside and utterly scrumptious. Even though this was the first time for, me though  I've eaten many before, this one was something special.\n\nFollowing a casual stroll around the local shops, our group treated themselves to what the area is best known for: mouth-watering Kobe meat. Our chef prepared it in right front us by using specialized tools that appeared to be nothing more than wall paper scraps (it turns out they are special spatula). It turned to out incredibly soft, - the reason being that the cattle are occasionally provided with beer which helps to relax the muscles of these cows. You have to wonder, what effect would just one or two pinta do on *me*? oho!\n\nThat evening, rest didn't come easily. Instead, at 5.30 a. m.  \u2014 I completed the last  500 pages in a single go, reading the Harry potter series book. Among the baying of dogs and howls of cats and paper deliveries thundering through streets, along with the loud chirping of birds, night's rest was transformed into a full-blown documentary of urban wildlife. However, that time gave me a chance learn a handful of new words - like *'oswari,'* which literally translates to'sit,' ideally accompanied with strong authority, while holding a  tennis racket in hand, delivered to an extremely stubborn dog. Spoiler alert: that stubborn canine chose to ignore me.\n\nOn the next day, Tuesday that is, my wife and we paid a visit to local employment office to search for job opportunities. We were advised that we should visit the central branch of city, as there's a higher chance of finding job openings that suit foreigners as well as English speaking individuals. Although Reikos assistance \u2014 her translation and guidance in every single conversation - has been incredibly helpful - it can sometimes be a bit of frustration. Often, when the people talk to us in our own language, all I can do is smile and gesture towards her, like 'She can speak on behalf of me.' This makes the things easier to handle, of course, yet I am eager and determined to become self-dependent.\n\nTomorrow, were going back the employment centre, marking the start of end of 'holiday' part in my visa that has working-holiday visa in it. New adventures are waiting for us, however.\n\nBefore heading off, visited batting practice place - costing about a pound for an opportunity to throw 27 pitches with machine throwing at us. Since coming from the football as cricket background, throwing a ball is an odd concept. Sticking to slow setting, managed  to get  about thirty percent of pitches on target - fifteen percent, maybe, being the proper soaring hit. For a novice, not bad, don't you think?\n\nCurrently, feeling utterly exhausted, in best way possible. Hope you can wait for more stories. \n\nI polished the article to improve the following aspects:\n\n1. Grammar and sentence structure\n2. Clarity and coherence\n3. Fluency and style\n4. Vocabulary and expression\n5.Readability and flow","model1":"Qwen","model2":"llama","domain":"blog","operation":"polish"}

{"human":"       I've talked with (or e-mailed) four people today about Survivor. It's funny to me that everyone has a different idea of who should win or who is playing the game well. I have to admit, Boston Rob cracks me up. Usually he's an egotistical guy who thinks he owns the game. But, still, he's hilarious. And he loves (um, maybe loves...) Amber. She's alright, too. But together they are pretty funny. I just wonder how much of their relationship is genuine and how much is a strategy to try to win a million dollars. Anyway, last night on the show, the tribes were mixed up, except the weren't really mixed up. The pulled new buffs out of a jar and ended up just reversing tribes. Except Amber, who was shuffled to the other side to even up the teams. So, Boston Rob and Amber are split up. And it appeared to break Rob's heart. How sweet. I mean, he's going to live, it's just a game. He said he didn't care if the other tribe was living at his former camp with his stuff, but he did care that the other tribe has his girl. Sweet in a Boston Rob way. So, I'm rooting for them. And I hope there's still some spark for them when the game is over. Amber could have easily been voted out last night, but instead Jerri went. And that's fine by me.   I got an email about trees and birthdays today and some strange connection between the two. For certain birthdays, certain trees and their descriptions were associated. My birthday is a month from tomorrow and here's what the email said about me and my tree:   Poplar Tree (the Uncertainty) -- looks very decorative, talented, not very self-confident, extremely courageous if necessary, needs goodwill and pleasant surroundings, very choosy, often lonely, great animosity, great artistic nature, good organizer, tends to lean toward philosophy, reliable in any situation, takes partnership seriously.

{"human":"Renin-angiotensin system inhibitors are reported to be beneficial in delaying the onset of diabetes mellitus. Since islet blood hyperperfusion during hyperglycaemia may be detrimental to endothelium in pancreatic islets and eventually lead to beta-cell dysfunction, we studied acute and chronic effects of angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARB) on islet blood flow before and after glucose load.Islet blood flow was measured using the colour microsphere method in anaesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats before and 3 min after glucose injection.Olmesartan significantly reduced blood pressure, but did not affect islet blood flow 10 min after its injection. However, pretreatment with olmesartan blunted the glucose-induced increase in islet blood flow (62% of control). In rats treated with olmesartan or candesartan for 4 weeks, islet blood flow was not different from untreated control, whereas the glucose-induced increase in islet blood flow was significantly suppressed in chronically ARB-treated rats (olmesartan 59% of control, candesartan 64% of control, respectively). Acute or chronic treatment with ARB did not change insulin secretion before and in response to glucose load. Pancreatic or duodenal blood flow was not affected by ARB treatment, although acute olmesartan administration reduced pancreatic blood flow after glucose load.","LLM_1":"Angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARBs) have been implicated in delaying the onset of diabetes mellitus, potentially through modulation of islet hemodynamics. Given that hyperglycemia-induced islet hyperperfusion may impair pancreatic endothelial function and contribute to beta-cell dysfunction, this study investigated the acute and chronic effects of ARBs on islet blood flow under normoglycemic and hyperglycemic conditions. Islet blood flow was assessed using the colored microsphere technique in anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats, both before and 3 minutes following glucose administration. Acute administration of olmesartan significantly reduced systemic blood pressure without altering baseline islet perfusion; however, it markedly attenuated the glucose-stimulated increase in islet blood flow by 62% compared to control. In animals chronically treated with olmesartan or candesartan for four weeks, resting islet blood flow remained unchanged, whereas the hyperglycemia-induced rise in islet perfusion was significantly blunted (59% and 64% of control, respectively). Neither acute nor chronic ARB treatment affected insulin secretion in the basal state or during glucose challenge. While ARB intervention did not alter duodenal blood flow, a reduction in pancreatic blood flow following glucose load was observed after acute olmesartan administration, despite no effect on overall pancreatic perfusion under baseline conditions. These findings suggest that ARBs selectively modulate glucose-induced islet hyperperfusion without disrupting systemic insulin release, supporting a potential protective role in islet vascular regulation during metabolic stress.","LLM_2":"**Abstract**\n\nAngiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARBs) have been associated with a delayed onset of diabetes mellitus, a phenomenon that may involve the regulation of pancreatic islet hemodynamics.

You and mom surely had to feel this way.'' \n He ignores the clutching of his chest and stands, turning to his son, `` That's different, what we do is our duty. It is our financial duty to the state to ensure that you are cared for. You were born to be great you understand? The finest genes have gone into you, you will be a fine leader some day.'' \n His son nods again, yet understanding eludes him. His feet shift around the bed and he still does n't look up. \n `` Simon, you've told this little girl you love her, do you understand what that means? It means you are selfish. You've committed yourself to her alone, and what of the rest if us? What of the community? Do you mean to abandon us for the sake of the one?'' \n Simon stirs, `` But dad-'' \n `` But nothing, you know your duty. Love is something for the all, not the one. There is no love of the one without corrupting the self. Once you ignore that, marriage will be arranged to you, so you may devote yourself to the growth of a unit, and you may give yourself to the community. There is purpose in marriage, there is purpose in procreating, but love is foolhardy. It fades as all things do.'' \n Simon nods and turns over in bed, his father watches him a second more, and pats his sons head. He watches Simon a moment more, and flips out his bedroom light and leaves the room. \n He walks to his bedroom, and breathing deeply, opens the door. His wife sits in bed, reading the latest propaganda from the state. She does n't look up, and in her tired voice says, `` And?'' \n He changed into his pajamas, and assumes his position next to her, `` We talked, he still does n't understand.'' \n She looks to him and smiles, `` He will come around, it's or the good of all.'' \n She reaches over and pats his shoulder. He winces slightly at the cold touch, and hopes she does n't notice. She rolls over, flicks off her light, and slips into a deep sleep. \n He stays awake, rolls over and watches his wife's side rise and fall. He watches her for what feels like hours, watches her slumber through the night. Tears well up in the mans eyes, and he slowly reaches out to her. His hand hovers just above her shoulder. To touch her, to love her, is not his duty. He feels above her body, feeling her warmth and breathing in her scent in the warm evening air, like laundry and old perfume. \n He wipes away his tears and turns away from her. He moves to the edge of the bed and wipes his eyes for himself and for Simon. For the good of all, and for the good of community and each other, he is alone, he is distant. \n He waits until sleep draws him into her warm arms.\n","LLM_1":"He stood before his son, hands clasped tightly behind his back, spine rigid, face carved from silence. In his grip, a crumpled sheet of paper\u2014its surface marred by jagged strokes of ink, words like *sin*, *shame*, *betrayal* scrawled across the white expanse as if in accusation. His son sat on the edge of the bed, red sneakers dangling just above the floor, thumbs restless in his lap, tracing invisible patterns. Eyes fixed on the ground. A tear slipped free, then another, carving quiet paths down his cheeks.\n\n\"Son.\" The word cracked through the stillness like gunfire. \"I need you to explain this.\"\n\nHe extended the paper toward him, the title at the bottom trembling in the dim light: *Love Simon*. The name hung in the air, soft and heavy, like the toll of a distant bell. Simon didn\u2019t look up. His breath hitched, fragile.\n\nThe man exhaled sharply, shoulders sagging. He folded the paper slowly, tucked it into his pocket, and sat beside his boy. His hand came to rest on Simon\u2019s back\u2014tentative, weighted\u2014a slow circle of pressure between the shoulder blades. They stayed that way, suspended in silence, two figures bound by blood and something deeper, something unspoken.\n\n\"Simon,\" he said, voice lower now, strained, \"you can't be caught with this. This\u2026 this is sin. Do you understand?\"\n\nSimon nodded, once, twice, but the gesture lacked conviction. His feet shifted, toes brushing the carpet. Still, he wouldn\u2019t meet his father\u2019s eyes.\n\n\"Dad,\" he whispered, \"I don\u2019t get it. You and Mom\u2014you must\u2019ve felt this way too, right?\"\n\nA pang shot through the man\u2019s chest. He rose abruptly, turning away, jaw clenched. \"That's different. What we do\u2014is duty. It\u2019s our obligation, our *financial* duty to the state, to ensure your future, your care. You were born for greatness. Engineered from the finest genes. One day, you\u2019ll lead. You have a purpose beyond yourself.\"\n\nAnother nod. Hollow. Distant. Simon curled into himself, knees drawing inward.\n\n\"Simon,\" his father pressed, turning back, voice sharpening, \"you told that girl you love her. Do you know what that means? It means you\u2019ve chosen one over all. It means selfishness. You bind yourself to a single soul and abandon the rest of us\u2014the community. Would you forsake everyone for the sake of one heart?\"\n\nSimon stirred, fingers tightening in his lap. \"But Dad\u2014\"\n\n\"No. There are no *buts*. You know your duty. Love isn\u2019t meant for one\u2014it belongs to all. To give it to a single person corrupts the self, fractures the whole. When the time comes, your marriage will be arranged. You\u2019ll build a unit. Serve the collective. Procreation has purpose. Marriage has purpose. But *love*?\" He almost spat the word. \"Love is reckless. It fades. It fails. It\u2019s not for people like us.\"\n\nSimon turned onto his side, back facing his father, blankets pulled halfway up his shoulders. The man watched him\u2014small, broken, so young\u2014and reached out. Gently, he patted the boy\u2019s head, lingered a moment too long. Then he rose, flipped off the light, and stepped into the hall.\n\nHe walked to his own room, breath deepening with each step. The door opened softly. His wife sat upright in bed, bathed in the pale glow of a state-issued reader, its screen pulsing with propaganda. She didn\u2019t look up.\n\n\"And?\" she asked, voice thin with fatigue.\n\n\"We talked,\" he said, stripping off his shirt, folding it with ritual precision. \"He doesn\u2019t understand.\"\n\nShe glanced at him then, offered a tired smile. \"He will. In time. It\u2019s for the good of all.\"\n\nHer hand brushed his shoulder\u2014cool, perfunctory. He flinched, subtle, hoping she hadn\u2019t noticed. She rolled over, switched off her light, and within minutes, her breathing slowed, evened. Sleep took her swiftly.\n\nHe lay awake.\n\nOn his side, watching her\u2014the steady rise and fall of her chest beneath the sheets, the curve of her shoulder, the faint scent of laundry soap and faded perfume clinging to her skin, warm in the night air. His fingers twitched. Slowly, he reached out. Hovered just above her. A whisper from contact. To touch her\u2014to truly *touch* her, not as partners in duty, but as lovers, as equals, as humans\u2014would be rebellion.\n\nTears gathered, silent, relentless. He let them come. Let them slip down his temples, dampen the pillow. For a moment, he imagined pressing his palm to her back, feeling the heat of her, breathing her in, remembering what it was to want someone not because the state decreed it, but because his soul ached for hers.\n\nHe withdrew. Wiped his face. Rolled to the far edge of the bed\u2014where the mattress dipped cold and untouched. Alone. Distant. Not by walls, but by vows, by law, by the weight of belonging to everyone and no one.\n\nFor the good of all.  \nFor the strength of the community.  \nFor the illusion of unity.\n\nHe closed his eyes. Waited. Until sleep, gentle and indifferent, finally pulled him under.","LLM_2":"He towered over his slumped son in rigid silence: hands locked behind a stiffened back; face a mask of unyielding restraint. Before him lay a crushed sheet, marbled by hasty, jaggy strokes, with *Sin*,*Shame**, *Betrayl*** etched across it in furious accusation, each word like a cold, accusatory slap. On the opposite side of their dimly lit room Simon sat, his red shoes dangling above a threadbare carpet, while his fingers eternched tiny patterns on his thighs. Tears seeped silently from his lowered eyes, forming glistening tracks on their pale surface.\n\nA single, jarring word shattered the quiet: \"Son.\"\n\nHis father held out the crumbled paper, crinkling the delicate title *'Love, Simon'* in faint, eerie tremors.  The words seemed to hang in mid-air, softly, heavily,  like  the  mournful  toll  of  a  far-off  bell  pealing  through  still  night.   Simon's  gaze  remained  resolutely  downcast,   his  breathing  fragile,    an  almost  imperceptible   hitch   betraying   a   faint   vulnerability.\n\nWith a sharp exhalation, this man's shoulders dropped, defeated. Folding the sheet with measured care, it slipped into a pocket. With measured steps, they drew closer, until they sat side by side on a narrow bed. Their fingers intertwined, one hand settling heavy and tentative on  Simon 's  slumping  back.    For  an   eternity,     the   world   held  its  breath,      as   two   souls,       bound  by  shared  blood,        yet  unseen  ties,          froze   in   silent   contemplation.\n\nThen, in a voice reduced to strained lowness, 'Simon,' the father spoke, trying to shake the fragile boy from a dreamy haze. 'You can\u2019t be found with that. That\u2019s sin, son. Can you comprehend?'\n\nSimon\u2019s small form nodded twice. However, despite his slight motion, an undertone of uncertainty clung to it like an unshed tear.\n\nHis son\u2019s voice trembled, tiny, yet unmistakable. \u2018Dad, I don't get this at all.\u2019 The whispered words hung on an uncertain breath. \n\nHis  father's   face   contorted, tightening    like   the skin of an overripe fruit.     'That\u2019s different,' he began, spitting out words.      'What we share is our duty - our  obligation  to  serve  -  our   *Financial*  Duty  To  State. We must ensure the future and your well-being, for your sake and for our own.' His voice hardened, tone cold. *Engineered  from  finest  genes*,  he  reminded, *you  were  born  for  greatness*.    You  will  lead  and  your  purpose  is  beyond  yourself.*\n\nA hollow nod, almost imperceivable, echoed his words.\n\nSimon curled inward, into an untouchable, unseen self. As the room grew darker, heavy shadows danced across his small, vulnerable form.\n\n'You  told  her  you  love  them,' his   father  pressed  on, sharp   and   unforgiving, \u201cDo  You   Understand?    Love  isn't  something  we  choose;  it's a selfish  act.         You'd  be  binding  oneself  over  all  others, abandoning  everyone  else  in  this  community  that  nurtures  us.           You're  forsaking  everything  \u2013  people  who  care  about  me, about us \u2013 to follow your heart.          You'll  bind  yourselves  together,         yet, sacrifice  what  makes  humanity  strong  -- our unity.\u201d\n\nSimon  stirred  then  tightened  his fists. \u201cBut, Dad--\u201d\n\n\"No.\"  His  voice  sliced  sharp, cutting  off  words  before  they  could  take  form.       \"You   understand   your   duty   perfectly.        Love   isn  meant  not  just  one, \nbut  belongs  itself  \u2014  It  corrupting  ourselves, fracturing  whole  communities. \nWhen  time  comes  marriage  must  have  been  arranged,  \nyou'll   serve   us, build   our unit, give  birth  children. Purpose  lies  within  duty and love isn 't  worth  any  risk  at  cost  Of  Our  Strength  Community's Unity\"\n\nThe words fell like leaden weights on that fragile form, who shifted his gaze, avoiding the pain, pain of his parents' cold words, their cold world. Blankets pulled up, covering the tears that had been silently shed. Back turned, eyes sealed, frozen on nothingness.\n\nIn the darkness, time passed, minutes ticking away. Footsteps echoed softly through a dim hallway, before a door creaked open. Behind it lay the wife's bed \u2013 bathes softly in pale, ghostly light from an official reader. Her eyes stayed closed. An almost faint voice drifted through sleep\u2019s heavy veil, asking, tired, thin.\n\n\u201cDid you talk to him?\u201d\n\nThe father stood, still, motionless, unbreathing, over the threshold of darkness that divided their world.\n\n\u2018He  doesn't'  understand. \u2019\n\nA tired  smile  hovered, momentarily, on her lips, though it couldn\u2019t quite touch the tiredness of that face.\n\n\"He  does. Time  heals. And  ultimately, everything we choose is for good.\"\n\nA  soft  hand  brushed  against his, cool, nonchalant. Yet, within that momentary touch, there was a flash of hidden pain. Hidden anger. Like a secret locked away behind an impenetrable mask.\n\nAnd  so, she  rolled  away  again, leaving  him  alone, lost  once  more  beneath  sheets. Within  minutes  she'd   find   her   way   into   sleep's gentle, comforting depths. Softly  sleeping  as  if  nothing  had  happened.\n\nYet  another  darkness  loomed  ahead, where shadows  waited  patiently, silently, ready to devour the tender heart that lay trembling, alone.\n\nOne  gentle  moment  slipped  into  existence, when  hands  didn't touch. Hands  tremble  instead, hovering  inches  above, hesitant to let love slip free. Between his wife and him stood a gulf of pain \u2013 a void carved by unfulfilled love. Each night would echo with the same desperate longing. Longing for that forbidden love, which was, at its core, nothing but a silent rebellion against the rules that governed their lives.\n\nAs  tears  gathered  silently  upon  their  temples  tonight, too. Tonight, more than ever, love yearned to take flight, free from all expectations and the duty that bound them, bound their hearts. Bound their love.\n\nBut  no. No  touch  was  ever  given. Only  cold  silence  between  two  souls  bound, trapped, suffocated  under  expectations, beneath vows that separated them. Separate. Forgotten.\n\nSo  sleep  eventually  came  softly  with  indifference, taking  hold  gently  after  weighing  heavily. Unfelt. Uncaring. Leaving  only  shadows, darkness. Silence. Darkness. Cold. Lonely. Lost. Once more. Forever. Always. Together. Separated. By vows. Law. Duty. Community. Unity. Strength. Good.

He was pretty sure he had n't actually fallen asleep, even though the voice had been droning on for about a half-hour now, asking pointless questions. He replayed the last few words in his head. The teacher had asked him for.... something... Iraq! That was it! \n \n `` WMDs, sir?'' Mr. C insisted that everyone call him sir. He said that he had served as an officer in `` the war'' but was always evasive about exactly what war that was. The first few people to suggest, outside of the class that he had never served as anything more dangerous than a McDonald's burger-flipper had ended up with a week's detention. Mr C. could n't possibly have heard the comment, but no one had ever figured out who the snitch had been. \n \n `` Thank you, Mr. Smith. It's good to know someone in this class is actually paying attention, even if they're only paying attention to the propaganda. In point of fact, Weapons of Mass Destruction were used as an excuse, but...'' As Mr C. turned away from him, Terry allowed himself to slip back into the same daze the rest of the class was in. \n \n Terry awoke to a sticky sensation in the back of his neck. He felt there to find a spitball was stuck there. He resisted the urge to turn around and look at the culprit, for two reasons - he knew who it had been ( Steve Greco ) and he knew that if Mr C saw someone not facing forward in class, that'd be a week's detention. Mr C. was facing the whiteboard for now, but somehow, he always knew when someone turned away, and issued detention accordingly. \n \n His slumber interrupted, he tuned back into his instructor's voice. ``... And then the Russians, having been emboldened by the annexation of Crimea, decided to send an army into Belarus in August 2017, in order to reunite more of the original Soviet union. This, in turn, caused the following five things to happen...'' \n \n Mercifully, the bell rang at that point, and there was a mad rush to the exit. Mr C. futilely called to the backs of his students. `` For next week, I want you all to have read up on Russia's expansionist policies in the mid-2010s.'' \n \n Terry took a little longer to get out the door, having to stretch after his nap, but he could n't help stopping to correct Mr C. on the way out. `` Sir?'' \n \n Mr. C did n't look up from his desk, where he was scribbling notes. `` Hmm? Yes, Mr. Smith?'' \n \n `` I just wanted to let you know that you got one of your dates wrong. You mentioned August 2017, but that has n't happened yet.'' He tried to keep the smirk off his face about having caught the senile old coot. Indeed, the man looked confused. \n \n `` I'm sorry, Mr. Smith. What's the date today?'' \n \n `` It's the 29th,'' the student stated, the smirk starting to show through. Mr C. looked at Terry as if he were expecting more than that. `` Of April.'' Mr C. continued with the blank stare, so Terry finally contributed, `` 2016.'' \n \n `` Ah.'' Mr C. finally responded. `` Well, we ca n't have that. If you received knowledge of the future, who knows what could happen. We'll need to fix it.'' \n \n Mr. C pulled something out of his pocket, and fiddled with a few dials. As Terry was going to ask what the thing was, the room spun, and Terry felt like he was caught in an interminable yawn. He staggered into the nearest empty chair and slumped onto the desk. He heard his name called. `` Smith?'' \n \n Terry sat up in his chair.

He was fairly certain he hadn\u2019t actually fallen asleep\u2014though the teacher\u2019s voice had been droning for nearly half an hour, reciting questions that felt more like rhetorical traps than invitations to learn. He replayed the last few seconds in his mind. The question\u2026 something about Iraq. Right.\n\n\u201cWMDs, sir?\u201d  \n\nMr. C insisted on being called *sir*. He claimed he\u2019d served as an officer in \u201cthe war,\u201d though he never specified which one. A few students, emboldened by boredom, once whispered outside class that the only uniform he\u2019d likely worn was a McDonald\u2019s visor. Those students vanished into week-long detentions. Mr. C couldn\u2019t have heard them\u2014but someone had. And no one ever discovered who.\n\n\u201cThank you, Mr. Smith,\u201d Mr. C said, with a tight smile that didn\u2019t reach his eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s reassuring to see at least one of you is awake\u2014even if you\u2019re only awake to the propaganda. In truth, weapons of mass destruction were used as a pretext. But\u2026\u201d As he turned back to the whiteboard, Terry let himself sink once more into the hazy lull that had settled over the rest of the classroom.\n\nHe came to with a cold, sticky prick at the base of his neck. His fingers found it immediately\u2014a spitball, lodged like a tiny landmine in his hair. He resisted the urge to turn around. Not because he didn\u2019t know who did it (Steve Greco, three rows back, smirking into his elbow), but because Mr. C had an uncanny radar for disobedience. Face forward or face consequences. Detention, every time. Even now, with Mr. C\u2019s back turned, scribbling dates and doctrines across the board, Terry could feel the weight of unseen surveillance.\n\nRoused, he tuned back in just as the lecture resumed. \u201c\u2026and then the Russians, emboldened by the annexation of Crimea, launched a full incursion into Belarus in August 2017, aiming to reclaim more of the former Soviet Union. This, in turn, triggered five major consequences\u2026\u201d\n\nThe bell rang\u2014mercifully, abruptly\u2014and chairs scraped as bodies stampeded toward the door. Mr. C raised his voice after them, futile as a lighthouse warning waves. \u201cFor next week, I expect all of you to have read up on Russia\u2019s expansionist policies in the mid-2010s.\u201d\n\nTerry lingered, stretching out the stiffness of his nap, but paused at the threshold. He couldn\u2019t resist. \u201cSir?\u201d\n\nMr. C didn\u2019t look up, jotting something in red ink. \u201cHmm? Yes, Mr. Smith?\u201d\n\n\u201cI just wanted to point out\u2014you got one of your dates wrong. August 2017 hasn\u2019t happened yet.\u201d\n\nA flicker of amusement danced at the edge of his lips. Mr. C stared blankly.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the date today?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe 29th,\u201d Terry said, savoring the moment.\n\nMr. C waited.\n\n\u201cOf April.\u201d\n\nStill nothing.\n\n\u201c2016.\u201d\n\n\u201cAhh.\u201d A slow nod, as if recalling a distant memory. \u201cWell. We can\u2019t have that. If you\u2019ve glimpsed the future, the timeline could unravel. Best to correct it.\u201d\n\nHe reached into his coat and pulled out a small, brass device\u2014gears faintly whirring, dials glowing like embers. Before Terry could ask what it was, the room twisted. The walls breathed. Time stretched like taffy, and Terry felt himself falling into an endless yawn, limbs heavy, vision tunneling. He stumbled sideways, collapsing into an empty desk, forehead pressing against cool laminate.\n\nSomeone called his name. \u201cSmith?\u201d\n\nHe sat up in his chair. He was pretty sure he hadn\u2019t actually fallen asleep, even though the voice had been droning on for about a half-hour now, asking pointless questions. He replayed the last few words in his head. The teacher had asked him for... something... Iraq! That was it!","LLM_2":"Terence Smith's eyes snapped open, his gaze drifting from the drab classroom to Mr.C, who stood at his desk with an air of expectation. \"And does anybody know the reason behind the Iraq invasion in March 1990? Or was that 1979?\" Mr C's voice trailed off, inviting a response from his students.\n\nTerrience sat straight up from what he was certain was just a brief doze. No one had ever fallen fully asleep in Mr.. C. class. At least, not that anyone dared admit to. Yet, for a moment, Terence couldn't shake the feeling that he'd lost track of time.\n\n\"WMD's, Sir?\" he ventured, testing the waters.\n\nHis teacher, a gruff man in a faded blazer, allowed a faint smile to creep onto his face. Some said Mr... C wore a uniform, though it wasn't from any war. Others whispered that his only experience in uniform was from working at McDonald's. Whatever the truth might be, one thing was for sure: Mr.... C made sure his authority was respected.\n\n\"Thank You, Smith,\" Mr.C said with the faintest hint of warmth in this voice, \"It's reassuring that at last one student is paying attention.

Terrence caught his eye, then looked away, sensing the unspoken warning.\n\nAs the lesson continued, Terrance tuned out once again. Ideas blurred and merged, until he became aware of a sticky sensation on the back of neck, like the aftermath of an unexploded land mine. It was then that Terrrance realized he wasn\u2019t alone. Steve Grecco, sitting three seats back and smiling to himself, was the culprit. Terrrence felt a shiver run down his spine. Had Mr... C seen him?\n\nTerrrence tuned in to hear Mr.. C mention Russia's invasion into Crimea in February 1952. Or perhaps it should have been 1945? The dates blurred, becoming an indistinguishable jumble of wars and invasions.

What was he doing?\n\nSuddenly, M. took out some device, its gears whirling and lights flickering. As T looked on, The room shifted. Walls seemed to breathe. Temp slowed down, t. felt the floor below him.\n\nWhen he opened his Eyes, it all looked normal. Someone called, 'Smith?\"\n\nT sat Up in His chair, rubbing his forehead.

{"human":"Shadows are not self-aware, right? Or at least they should n't be. It's just not normal. It's just not right. In fact it's a little creepy. Maybe more than a little; a whole lot of creepy. Oh, and annoying too, frustrating even. Yeah. Very frustrating. \n \n It began with a minor delay. Scarcely noticeable, something I only ever saw out the corner of each eye and never questioned. Not until it got worse, anyway, and it did - fast. The big, `` Oh shit!'' moment happened in a public place, a park full of dog-walkers, playing children, and Sunday Footballers of all places. I sat on a worn bench and sipped my coffee, raising the plastic lid to my lips and slurping away. The sun was strong and so was my shadow. He sat beside me, stretched across the bench and onto the pavement and instead of raising his cup-shadow to the outline of his lips he simply paused and scratched his little head as if he'd forgotten what to do. And then he jumped into action - raising his cup-shadow to mimic me - slowly and awkwardly, probably hoping I had n't seen him miss a beat. A lump of shock began to swell at the back of my throat. I froze. Still. Tried to swallow. Could n't. The piping hot liquid tickled the back of my throat and burnt my tongue. I tried again, needed to swallow. Could n't. Oh, man, how it burnt. My body twitched - convulsed. My shadow did n't. And out and upwards darted my coffee, alongside `` Oh shit!'' at the top of my lungs. \n \n The rest seemed to happen in slow-mo. The coffee shot out in front of me like liquid tentacles reaching out towards its target. My second hand coffee showered a passing Father and his Daughter. She burst into tears, my shadow burst into silent laughter like a mocking mime - all he needed was a beret and a striped jumper. He even slapped his knee and held himself. Despite my whimpered apologies, her Father sent me swivelling onto my ass with a clean punch to the nose. Distant Sunday Footballers laughed and jeered. \n \n I've taken to calling him Shadow, because that's what he is and naming him anything else feels kind of weird - crazy almost, although Shadow does sound a little intimidating. I think he can understand me too, it's just that most of the time he chooses not to. He has the kind of selective hearing that troublesome elderly gents `` suffer'' from. Sometimes I catch him peeking up women's skirts or under cubicle doors, and when I whisper `` Oi, oi - stop that!'' He simply does n't. You should see some of the looks I get from peers and passers by. Yet I've confronted him, asked him questions and gotten answers. Innocent shrugs mostly, nods every now and then. So, yeah, I think he understands me. \n \n Sometimes he still acts normal as well, a little delayed but again - scarcely noticeable - only time he acts up is when somebody takes notice of him. He plays up like a first born amongst siblings in a battle for attention. He'll stick a finger up, make thrusting motions and blow kisses, or unleash a stringy beam of shadow-piss. Then people just look up to me like, `` How are you doing that?'' or `` Mate, are you sticking your finger up at me?'' I guess Shadow's just a hard guy to keep ship-shape and maybe that's why he's driving me fucking crazy. \n \n I think the main problem is that we're attached. That, or he's following me. Think I need to find a way to separate us. That'll give me a little peace of mind. Probably.

Still\u2014they feel like replies.\n\nMost days, he plays along. Stays in line. A slight delay, maybe, but nothing obvious. Only when someone *sees* him\u2014really looks\u2014does he go feral.

Patients were classified based on histopathological findings into three categories: adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS; n = 47), minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA; n = 30), and invasive adenocarcinoma (I-ADC; n = 24). Various demographic and radiological parameters\u2014such as age, sex, smoking history, tumor size, and computed tomography (CT) attenuation\u2014were analyzed across these groups. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses were employed to assess the diagnostic efficacy of these variables in predicting invasive histology. The results indicated that tumor size was significantly larger in the MIA and I-ADC groups compared to the AIS group (p < 0.05). Additionally, CT attenuation was notably higher in the I-ADC group when contrasted with both the AIS and MIA groups (p < 0.05). ROC analysis revealed that a tumor size threshold of 11 mm achieved a sensitivity of 95.8% and a specificity of 46.8% (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.75). Conversely, a CT attenuation threshold of -680 Hounsfield units (HU) yielded a sensitivity of 95.8% and a specificity of 35.1% (AUC = 0.77). The combined application of both criteria (tumor size \u2265 11 mm and CT attenuation \u2265 -680 HU) resulted in an improved specificity of 71.4%, while maintaining a sensitivity of 91.7% and enhancing the AUC to 0.82. These findings underscore the importance of tumor size and CT attenuation as significant predictors of pathological invasion in pulmonary GGNs, suggesting that their integration may enhance preoperative risk stratification.","model1":"Qwen","model2":"gpt4o_mini","domain":"pubmedqa","operation":"rewrite"}

The bleating cows stop, sensing the sudden strange stillness of the water. The old rancher closes his eyes, knowing the event upon him. The demons gnash and writhe, knowing the prey are near.

{"human":"             Well I'm writing this from a computer in Montreal.    So here is a minute by minute account of my time here.  We went to the airport, and we got on the plane --which actually left right on time, and arrived right on time- and came off in Montreal where we were picked up by my aunt Patti because we were going to stay with her and Uncle Gil.  We went to their house and ate a whole chicken that we bought from the store and some different salads, also from the store. Then we watched American idol (a first for me!) but they were having an ooey gooey song week and so it wasn't really that good. Then I went to bed, took a long time to fall asleep, and woke up at 6:30. (Very early for me, I'm usually not up until 8:30 at my house). So the next day began. I had breakfast, and there is a large value village near Gil and Patti's house, so we went there and I bought a pair of pants. Then we had lunch, and then everybody except for me took a nap and I watched a movie. Then Kevin and Ania, they are some of my other aunts and uncles, came over to visit us. Pattie had to go to the store to get mint jelly, and so I went with her, and we went to this store that she said was good so I could buy a belt, because my pants were falling down, and I picked one out, and then she decided she would pay for it which was REALLY nice of her and I was\/am really thankful. Then we went back home and kevin and ania stayed for about 20 minutes more. Then they had to leave, and Patti had invited a family with 4 daughters for supper, and she had made roast lamb and salad and potatoes and green and yellow beans. They were pretty nice only they were asking me a bunch of questions about my spiritual life like 'Are you a strong Christian?' I felt like saying 'No I'm VERY weak' but I said yes, and she turns to her oldest daughter and says 'Isn't that great Rebecca, she's the oldest in her family AND  she's a strong Christian.' I always used to hate it when my mom would point out ANY similarities between me and whoever, and I just felt really embarrassed. She asked me a bunch of other spiritual questions too, but I won't waste your time. Other than that they were really nice. Then I went to bed again, and woke up at 7:00 this time, and not it is 9:00 and here I am blogging. I hope this minute by minute account of my time here is long enough for you guys!         ","LLM_1":"Sitting at a computer in Montreal, I\u2019m diving into a detailed snapshot of my first few days here\u2014minute by minute, just for you.  \n\nOur journey started smoothly: we arrived at the airport, boarded our flight (which, impressively, took off and landed right on schedule), and were greeted in Montreal by my aunt Patti. We\u2019d be staying with her and Uncle Gil, which immediately made the trip feel more personal and warm. After settling in, we headed straight to dinner\u2014a whole rotisserie chicken from the store, paired with an array of salads, also store-bought but delicious all the same.  \n\nThat night, we unwound with *American Idol*\u2014my very first time watching! Unfortunately, it was \u201cOoey Gooey Song Week,\u201d which basically meant overly sentimental ballads dominating the lineup. Not exactly my cup of tea, so I didn\u2019t linger too long before heading to bed. Falling asleep took a while\u2014jet lag, maybe\u2014but once I did, I woke up surprisingly early: 6:30 a.m. For me, that\u2019s practically sunrise. At home, I\u2019m rarely up before 8:30.  \n\nDay two kicked off with breakfast and then a little retail therapy. There\u2019s a Value Village nearby that Gil and Patti love, so we stopped by. Scored a great pair of pants\u2014essential, since my old ones had been slipping. Lunch followed, and while everyone else napped (a solid Canadian pastime, it seems), I caught a movie solo.  \n\nLater, Aunt Patti\u2019s siblings Kevin and Ania came over for a visit. Casual and cozy, they stayed for about twenty minutes before heading out. Then came one of those unexpectedly kind moments: Patti needed mint jelly and offered to take me along. While we were out, she suggested I pick up a belt\u2014the pants purchase demanded accessories, after all. I found one I liked, and before I could even reach for my wallet, she insisted on covering it. That gesture? So thoughtful. I\u2019m still genuinely grateful.  \n\nBack home, the evening shifted gears again when Patti hosted a family of six\u2014four daughters included\u2014for dinner. She\u2019d prepared a beautiful spread: roast lamb, potatoes, green and yellow beans, and a crisp salad. The meal was fantastic, though the conversation got a little intense. The mom zeroed in on my spiritual life, asking things like, \u201cAre you a strong Christian?\u201d My inner sarcasm wanted to reply, \u201cNope, actually I\u2019m *very* weak,\u201d but I smiled and said yes. Then she turned to her eldest daughter and said, \u201cIsn\u2019t that wonderful, Rebecca? She\u2019s the oldest in her family *and* a strong Christian.\u201d Cue major secondhand cringe. It reminded me of how my mom used to point out similarities between me and other kids, always in front of everyone. Same awkward energy. More faith-focused questions followed, but I\u2019ll spare you the sermon.  \n\nAll in all, they were lovely people\u2014just a bit much on the personal interrogation front.  \n\nAnother early bedtime, another early wake-up\u2014this time at 7:00 a.m. Now it\u2019s 9:00, and here I am, typing away.  \n\nHope this play-by-play gives you a real feel for my Montreal rhythm so far.","LLM_2":"Our adventure began seamlessly.

{"human":"- Overview: This work presents a unified formulation of various (phrase and token level) NLP tasks. They use this formulation to devise a single model architecture that, when trained individually on 10 diverse NLP tasks, can get near SOTA performance on all of them. They additionally conduct experiments to determine when multitask learning is useful for this set of tasks, which is made easy due to the unified framework. The stated main contributions are\n    - unified formulation of 10 diverse NLP tasks, including NER, constituency + dependency, parsing, POS tagging, sentiment, coref., relation extraction, SRL, information extraction, and more\n    - a benchmark of pre-existing datasets for each of these tasks\n    - experiments on their benchmark in pushing the state of the art \n    - experiments leveraging their task formulation and benchmark to analyze the effectiveness of multitask learning under a variety of settings.\n\n- Review: The paper as-is is not as novel as the authors claim, and I recommend a weak reject. That said, I think there is a lot of interesting work and analyses in the latter half of the work, and I think with some reframing, this could be a really nice work.\n- I'm not convinced of the novelty of the formulating various NLP tasks as span and and relation labelling. As the authors point out (somewhat concerningly buried on a footnote on page 4), Tenney et al.[1] use present a very similar framework for these tasks, also with the aim of having uniform task format and model architecture. The authors rightly point out a key difference between their work and [1]: The latter's work uses this unified framework in the context of analyzing pertained models (with no training), rather than training a model to perform as well as on these tasks as possible. As a result, [1] uses gold span information, whereas this paper also needs to predict those spans. While this difference in setting is fairly substantial, it doesn't change the fact that [1] previously unified a similar suite of tasks with more or less the same framework, which I believe significantly weakens this work's main stated claim of novelty.\n- I appreciate the effort to standardize analysis tasks in NLP. However, I think there's some tension in trying to group the proposed set of tasks into a sub-sentence-level language understanding benchmark and calling it an analysis tool. In providing a training set for each task and expecting users of the benchmark to train\/fine-tune on each task, we lose the ability to say a pretrained model contains information for X task (e.g. \"My model has a strong sense of named entities\"). On the other hand, I suppose you gain some insight into how well your pertained model can be adapted for these NLP tasks, which is also useful but I think not how analysis tasks are usually implemented.\n- Matching previous (single-task) SOTA on each of the 10 tasks individually doesn't seem hugely interesting to me. It doesn't seem too surprising that pretained LMs perform well regardless of the task format \/ architecture. We see this in question answering where concatenating the question to the context is as effective as QA-specific architectures [2].\n- That being said, I think there is still a lot of interesting work and results here. For me, the most interesting part is the analysis for which tasks are mutually beneficial or harmful. Determining and characterizing mutually beneficial tasks is a big open question, and these experiments are useful evidence and should be leaned into more, especially over the unified task formulation aspect. There's a lot more that could be done here, e.g. flushing out the experiments testing the various tasks under different amounts of training data or deeper analysis into why certain task pairs are helpful\/harmful (genre? both are semantic-y or syntactic? lots of word overlap between the datasets? etc.).\n\nThings to improve + Questions\n- The paper would strongly benefit from a more in-depth explanation of the covered tasks, perhaps in an appendix. The explanations on p3 feel redundant. The examples in Tables 2a,b do a lot of work, but some of the tasks and labels still could use more explanation. \n- I didn't really understand the phrase \"all pairs of remaining spans\". Are those the top-K \/ lowest NEG_SPAN probability spans?\n- What do $j$ and $k$ index ?\n- The conclusions from Tables 5 + 6 seem to contradict one another. Table 5, as you say, seems to suggest that \"as the contextualized representations become stronger, the performance of MTL+FT becomes more favorable\". On the other hand, Table 6 says that there seem to be many more mutually beneficial task pairs when using GloVe than when using BERT. Any hypotheses as to why this is ?\n- Figure 2 is hard to read because of the size and the legend formatting.\n\n[1] WHAT DO YOU LEARN FROM CONTEXT?

This approach allows a single model architecture to achieve nearly state-of-the-art performance across ten distinct tasks when trained independently. Additionally, the authors utilize this framework to explore the conditions under which multitask learning (MTL) proves advantageous, conducting comprehensive experiments on a newly created benchmark that consolidates existing datasets. The primary contributions of this work are: (1) a unified formalism that encompasses tasks such as named entity recognition (NER), part-of-speech (POS) tagging, dependency and constituency parsing, sentiment analysis, coreference resolution, relation extraction, semantic role labeling (SRL), and information extraction; (2) a curated benchmark featuring standardized versions of existing datasets for these tasks; (3) experimental outcomes that push the boundaries of the current state of the art across several tasks; and (4) an empirical assessment of MTL effectiveness across various scenarios.\n\n### Review\nWhile the manuscript presents a comprehensive and technically robust effort, I find the asserted novelty to be somewhat exaggerated, leading me to recommend a weak rejection in its present form. Nevertheless, the latter sections of the paper\u2014especially the analyses related to multitask learning\u2014offer valuable insights, and with suitable reworking, this could emerge as a significant contribution.\n\nThe central concept of framing diverse NLP tasks as span and relation labeling is not as innovative as implied.

It identifies three key limitations of the bisimulation metric and introduces the MICo distance as an alternative. For a given policy, the MICo distance is formally defined via the MICo update operator, which the authors prove to be a contraction mapping. They establish several theoretical properties of this distance, particularly its ability to address shortcomings inherent in the bisimulation metric. Furthermore, the authors propose a tractable approximation scheme targeting the unique fixed point of the contraction, enabling the practical application of MICo for shaping state representations in large-scale environments. Empirically, they evaluate a modified version of the learned MICo approximation combined with UMAP, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting value functions and showing improved performance when state representations are trained jointly with the MICo loss.\n\n**Originality**\n\nThe introduction of the MICo operator represents a meaningful methodological contribution. While it may be viewed as a simplification of the bisimulation operator\u2014particularly by circumventing the need for the Wasserstein metric\u2014the authors clearly articulate how their approach diverges from prior work and mitigates specific issues associated with bisimulation-based metrics. The proposed learned approximation to the MICo distance further enhances its practical applicability. Overall, the methods and theoretical derivations exhibit a commendable degree of novelty.\n\n**Quality**\n\nThe theoretical development up to Section 4\u2014including the definition of the MICo distance through the operator $T_M^\\pi$, its equivalence to the Bellman operator in an auxiliary MDP, the online approximation procedure, and the derivation of upper bounds on value function differences\u2014is technically rigorous and well-structured.\n\nIn Section 5, however, the definition of $U_{\\omega}$ (line 259) appears somewhat abrupt. Although the utility of $\\Pi U^\\pi$ is thoroughly demonstrated throughout the section and its relationship to $U_{\\omega}$ is evident, a more explicit justification for why the parametrized approximation of $U^\\pi$ takes the specific form introduced at line 259 would strengthen the exposition.\n\nRegarding the experiments in Section 6, while the evaluation across numerous Atari environments using various reinforcement learning algorithms\u2014with and without the MICo loss\u2014is comprehensive, the inclusion of additional comparisons with established baseline methods for representation shaping would further bolster the empirical validation.\n\n**Clarity**\n\nThe paper is generally clear, logically organized, and accessible.

Consequently, several essential theoretical attributes of said distance are delineated, especially its capacity to rectify the intrinsic shortcomings present in bisimilarities-based measurements.\n\nFurthermore, these authors also propose an efficient approximation strategy aimed at finding the singular fixed-point of such a contracting mapping, thereby rendering the applied practicality of utilizing MICoo for generating state illustrations in vast-scale domains. In an empirical evaluation, their adapted MICco approximation, amalgamated with a U-MAP, exhibits its efficacy in forecasting value functionalities and demonstrating enhanced performance whenever state representation training is concurrently conducted alongside the utilized MIC-co loss function.\n\n***Original Contribution***\n\nThe incorporation of a MIC-o operator constitutes a substantial methodical contribution to existing knowledge.

She could leap the distance of several cars, but he \u2019 d still keep pace. He wasn \u2019 t going to take her until the moment was right. \n \n Her vision adjusted to the dark, with the aid of the moon. She could see the lake through the trees, and she knew she was close to where she had to be. If she got there, she would be safe. She \u2019 d win this chase. \n \n Without warning, a sharpness cut into her side like a scythe. She wasn \u2019 t prepared for it; she never was. It dropped her into a shrieking ball.

{"human":"This paper describes a method that draws inspiration from neuroscience and aims to handle delayed feedback in continual learning (i.e., When labels are provided for images after a phase of unsupervised learning on the same classes). It is an interesting idea, and worth exploring.\n\nI found the paper quite hard to follow at times, and I suggest the authors go through the paper in detail to address some of the issues with grammar and clarity of explanation.\n\nIn addition, I think the paper is lacking some grounding and context in terms of what problem is being solved and what previous work exists.\nFor example, based on the experimental setup section it seems like the problem being addressed is that of unsupervised learning on CIFAR images followed by supervised learning on images with labels (i.e., Delayed feedback) - is this the case? If so, this is much more a semi-supervised learning or fine-tuning problem than a continual learning problem (which typically looks at a single class at a time or some other non-stationary sequence of tasks). Either way, the recent literature in semi-supervised learning and continual learning should be referenced - see the citations below as a few examples, and consider referencing and more closely perusing some of the examples in the cited review paper by Parisi et al (2019).\n\nLastly, the experiments show the performance as a function of queue length for different features and for CNNs versus decision trees, but there is no comparison to existing methods and very simple models are used - this means that again, it's difficult to gauge the efficacy of the approach and place this in the context of prior art.\n\nUnfortunately, I think the paper in its current state does not meet the bar for ICLR - I suggest the authors consult the vast literature in semi-supervised and continual learning, and try to place their work in this context, along with external comparisons.\n\n\nNguyen, Cuong V., et al. \"Variational continual learning.\"\u00a0arXiv preprint arXiv:1710.10628\u00a0(2017).\n\nLopez-Paz, David, and Marc'Aurelio Ranzato. \"Gradient episodic memory for continual learning.\"\u00a0Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 2017.\n\nMiyato, Takeru, et al. \"Virtual adversarial training: a regularization method for supervised and semi-supervised learning.\"\u00a0IEEE transactions on pattern analysis and machine intelligence\u00a041.8 (2018): 1979-1993.","LLM_1":"This paper proposes a neuroscience-inspired approach to address delayed feedback in continual learning, where labels are provided after an initial phase of unsupervised learning on the same set of classes. The core idea is conceptually interesting and merits further investigation.\n\nThat said, the manuscript suffers from several issues that hinder its clarity and overall impact. The presentation is at times difficult to follow, and I encourage the authors to thoroughly revise the text to improve grammatical accuracy and the clarity of their explanations.\n\nMoreover, the work lacks sufficient grounding within the broader machine learning landscape. The problem setting\u2014unsupervised pre-training on CIFAR followed by supervised learning with delayed labels\u2014appears more aligned with semi-supervised learning or fine-tuning paradigms than with standard formulations of continual learning, which typically involve sequential task acquisition or non-stationary data distributions. This distinction needs to be clarified. Regardless of the framing, the authors should engage more deeply with relevant literature in both semi-supervised and continual learning. For instance, the review by Parisi et al. (2019) provides a comprehensive overview of continual learning approaches and could help better position this work. Additional references such as Nguyen et al. (2017), Lopez-Paz & Ranzato (2017), and Miyato et al. (2018) offer pertinent context and should be considered.\n\nThe experimental evaluation also limits the paper\u2019s contribution. While results are shown for varying queue lengths and different model types (CNNs vs. decision trees), there is no comparison to established baselines or state-of-the-art methods. The use of relatively simple models further complicates the interpretation of performance.

{"human":"Haemorrhagic shock after traumatic injury carries a high mortality. Therapeutic hypothermia has been widely used in critical illness to improve the outcome in haemorrhagic shock by activation of cardiac pro-survival signalling pathways. However, the role played by the mitochondria in the cardioprotective effects of therapeutic hypothermia remains unclear. We investigated the effects of therapeutic hypothermia on mitochondrial function and integrity after haemorrhagic shock using an in vitro ischaemia-reperfusion model.H9c2 cardiomyocytes received a simulated ischaemic reperfusion injury under normothermic (37 \u00b0C) and hypothermic (31 \u00b0C) conditions.

Barbara Ehrenreich of *The New York Times* shares similar concerns.  \n\nIn her piece, \u201cIt\u2019s Over, Ralph,\u201d she makes some compelling points. For one, Nader isn\u2019t even running as the Green Party candidate this year, so he can no longer claim\u2014as he did in 2000\u2014that his campaign is about advancing their platform. Instead, he\u2019s sought support from the Reform Party, which notably ran Pat Buchanan\u2014someone widely criticized as a bigot or worse\u2014just a few years ago.

I\u2019m still processing what that means. On one hand, the upcoming 9\/11 Commission report is expected to assert links between Iran and al-Qaeda. If that\u2019s true, then why did we invade Iraq\u2014a country with far less connection\u2014while seemingly ignoring a nation that may have actually assisted the hijackers? On the other hand, if Iran was indeed involved, then addressing that threat becomes imperative.

There are credible reports suggesting that Prime Minister Allawi may have personally executed prisoners\u2014or at least ordered executions without trial.

As I'm not the only one to feel frustrated about his recent decisions, it's reassuring to see Barbara Ehenreich, columnist for *the NewYork Times*, share similar sentiments in her thought-provoking piece \"It's Over Ralph.\"\n\nIn \"Ralph's\" campaign, we're witnessing a departure from his original stance as Green party candidate in year 2010. His current affiliation with the reform party, notable for running Pat Bunchan\u2014a politician widely regarded as bigoted\u2014is cause for concern. Furthermore, his ties to New alliance party and conservative supporters who seem to have ulterior motives for backing him, such as aiding the election of George Shurb, raises questions about the true purpose of his candidacy.\n\nMoving on to other pressing issues, there's an unsettling trend emerging. The story \"Regiem Change In Iran \u2013 Now In Bush's Sighs\" suggests that Iran might be the next country on President Bush' radar screen. While interpreting this development is challenging, some possible links to al-Qaida could justify action. However, considering the US invaded Iraq despite its limited connections to terrorism, while seemingly overlooking Iran's potential involvement, leaves me puzzled. Perhaps we'll find some clarity in The upcoming report on 911 commission.\n\nLastly a recent article from Newsweek caught my eye. \"Iraq's New SOB\" sheds a light into some disturbing trends in what we call the \"New Iraq\". Reports indicate that prime Minister Aliwai may personally execute prisoners or order executions on trial, raising fears of a dictatorship masquerading as democracy.\n\nLet's hope that we can put aside our differences and focus on finding solutions that truly benefit our nation.

MSWC dominates every other keyword spotting dataset in size and coverage.\n\n\"we include the generated Praat textgrid alignments as part of our dataset release\" --> this is excellent. \"The high-resource languages are collectively spoken by 2.75 billion people.\" what does this mean? This is surely not the actual number of speakers\n\nSomeone might want to predict, for an entire _sentence_, whether the sentence contains the keyword or not---do the textgrids cover the entire sentence? or just the keyword portion? Alternately, you could list the source file from Common Voice alongside training examples for those who want to do this\n\n\"We train forced alignment from a flat start only on the Common Voice data itself, i.e., we do not rely on any external acoustic models\" --> even for low-resource langs? do you use phoneme-based lexica?\n\n\"Chinese\" = is this CV's \"zh-tw\", \"zh-cn\", \"zh-hk\" or all three?

Looks great. n\/a n\/a","LLM_1":"This paper presents the Multilingual Spoken Words Corpus (MSWC), a large-scale dataset of spoken words derived from the Common Voice corpus through forced alignment. Beyond the community-driven cleaning efforts in Common Voice, the authors employ an anomaly detection method to identify and filter out poor-quality samples, and they make their filtering code publicly available\u2014a valuable addition for reproducibility and further research. Models trained on MSWC demonstrate reasonably strong performance on the out-of-domain Google Speech Commands benchmark, highlighting the dataset\u2019s utility and generalizability. Given its scale and linguistic coverage, MSWC significantly surpasses existing keyword spotting datasets and is poised to become a key resource in the field.\n\nThe inclusion of generated Praat TextGrid alignments in the dataset release is an excellent decision, enabling fine-grained phonetic analysis and facilitating downstream applications. However, the claim that \"the high-resource languages are collectively spoken by 2.75 billion people\" requires clarification\u2014this figure likely refers to total population across regions rather than actual native speaker counts, and as such may be misleading without proper context.\n\nA potential use case involves performing keyword detection at the sentence level\u2014determining whether a given sentence contains the target keyword. Do the provided TextGrids annotate only the keyword segments or the full utterance? If only the keyword portion is aligned, it would be helpful to include the source audio file identifiers from Common Voice alongside each training example to allow users to retrieve complete sentences when needed.\n\nThe paper states that forced alignment is trained from a flat start using only Common Voice data, without reliance on external acoustic models. This is impressive, but it raises questions about how this approach performs for low-resource languages. Were phoneme-based lexicons used in those cases, and if so, how were they constructed?\n\nRegarding Chinese: does this refer to zh-tw, zh-cn, zh-hk, or a combination of all three? Clarification here would improve transparency. Overall, the work is very clearly presented, thoroughly reviewed, and extensively compared with existing keyword spotting resources. The contribution is significant and well-executed.","LLM_2":"This work introduces the MSWD, a substantial dataset for spoken word recognition, built by refining the data from Open Source Common voice through robust forced alignments. Notably, authors further enhance the quality of their dataset through anomaly filtering, leveraging a publicly shared codebase to facilitate reproducible research and foster community engagement. As a result, models trained using MSW demonstrate robust performance across the Google speech commands benchmark. Considering its scope and multilingual capabilities, this dataset outshines existing alternatives and has the potential to set a new standard in keyword recognition.\n\nProviding Praaat Textgrid alignments within the release proves particularly valuable, as it empowers users with granular phonetics analysis capabilities and opens doors to novel applications downstream. Nonetheless, some clarification is required to contextualize the assertion that high resource languages encompass 275 billion speakers; this figure seems to conflate native speakers and total populations, necessitating a nuanced discussion.\n\nOne potential avenue for further investigation involves integrating sentence-level keyword identification, where the task revolves around determining if a sentence includes the desired keyword or not. In this regard, does the annotation encompass the entire utterances or solely focus on keyword-specific segments? Including identifiers for source CommonVoice audio files alongside training examples could enable users access complete sentence contexts when required.\n\nInterestingly, forced aligning from scratch using Commonvoice alone, sans external models, is a remarkable accomplishment. Nevertheless, questions arise regarding the performance of this method across low resource language domains. Did phonetically-based dictionaries play a role in such cases? And if they did, what methodologies were employed in constructing these resources?\n\nFurthermore, for Chinese, clarification on whether this pertains to specific dialects (e.g., zh-tw, chinese, etc.) would enhance overall transparency and facilitate better comprehension of these contributions. Throughout, I found the paper to present its findings with clarity, rigor, in-depth comparisons to existing work, significant contributions, all executed with precision.

{"human":"`` Mom?'' My daughter said to me in a confused tone. \n `` Uh, yes sweetheart?'' I replied to my 4 year old daughter after snapping back into reality. \n `` Why do you always look at my mark? It's not a big deal. It's just an ugly brown spot.'' She said to me smiling. She looked down at her chest staring at the near perfect circle around her heart. \n `` It should been in heart shape, mom. That be silly.'' She giggled. \n I faked a smile and continued washing her hair in the bath. \n \n I laid next to her in her bed while I was waiting for her to fall asleep. I finished reading her the story of Cinderella, for what felt like the thousandth time. \n Her breathing got slower and slower until it reached a constant pace. She was asleep. And I was wide awake. \n Her mark was not just `` a silly circle that should've been in the shape of a heart''. I know what it means. And I know where she got it. \n Life as an assassin was never easy. And life as a retired assassin is no easier. Having to take care and protect Amanda with my life. I live alone, besides her. I'm never able to sleep more than 2 hours at a time ever since she was born. Sometimes I wonder if it was the right decision bringing her into this horrible world. But I still love her with all my heart. Nothing can happen to her. \n Not if I can help it. \n But how can I help it if I'm just sitting at home waiting for her to die? Yes, I'm protecting her, but I'm also practically just waiting for the assassins to come for her. And I'll probably die with her. What good will that do? \n I'm still young, I can still fight. After all, I have been training everyday. \n I must go back to The Guild. \n \n So, I will. \n \u2022 \n \u2022 \n \u2022 \n \n Many months have gone past. I've been in The Guild training. The assassin leader has been training me, one on one. I used to be his star pupil. And he does n't want to let that go to waste. \n I've told none of them about Amanda especially not him. Because after all my years here, I've learned to never trust anyone. Not even your closest allies. \n So, Amanda is at preschool. And later she'll go home to her friend's house. Like any normal 4 year old. \n No one in my life knows about her. And everyone in her life knows me as just the `` workaholic mom''. And that's how it should be. I've been called worse after all. \n \n I've been getting close to `` Shadow'', as he likes his associates to call him. But I'm the only one who knows his real name: Damien. He is the leader of assassins, the founder of The Guild. \n He trusts me. Which is quite ironic. He's the one who told me years ago, when I started training, to never trust anyone. \n Yet he trusts me. \n And I'm terrified. \n Because I do n't trust him. I do n't trust anyone. That's just who I am now. And he's already told me so much. About how he killed his brother for betraying him. He trusted his brother, but his brother sold information about him to the opposing assassins guild. Which almost got Damien killed. In return, Damien thrust a sword through his brothers heart in the middle of the night. Thus giving himself the name `` Shadow''. If Damien finds out that I do n't trust him. And that I would do anything for my daughter whom he knows nothing about. Then he would be beyond upset. But if he found out Amanda was also his. He would kill her in a heartbeat. \n \n I planned to go to my small, isolated apartment tonight. But Damien wants me to stay at The Guild for the night. He noticed the bags under my eyes. And he found out I've been getting no sleep. I never had to tell him. It's hard to hide anything from him. So if I said I just wanted to go home. He'd wonder why. He'd wonder what's at my apartment that's not here; and why I'd prefer to be there. He'd figure it all out too fast. \n So I stayed with him. \n \n That night was the first night I got a full nights sleep in years. It felt great. But I still had the subtle sense that something was still wrong. \n \n I went through the day with that feeling only getting worse. It got to the point where I just could n't handle it anymore. I've been away from home too long. \n \n `` I think I'm going to take a break from training. I'll be back tomorrow.'' I said, doing my best to sound disinterested and bored. \n Damien stared at me up and down for a couple seconds before responding. \n `` As you wish, Thea.'' \n \n And I left. \n \n I got to Amanda's friend's house to pick her up. \n I knock on the door. \n `` Umm hi.'' Said a little blonde girl who answered the door. \n `` Hello, is Amanda here?'' I asked, worried. \n `` Oh hello.'' The little girl's mom said as she walked to the right of her daughter. \n `` Amanda said you told her to go to y'alls apartment. So I just dropped her off no more than 15 minutes ago.'' The mother said. \n `` Oh.'' I would never tell Amanda to be at the apartment without me. Not even for 5 minutes. I know how fast assassins work after all. I could never have risked it. \n `` I'll see you another time then.'' I said quickly and walked hastily toward my car. \n \n \n I got to the apartment and struggled to unlock the door as the keys were slipping out of my sweating hands. I stopped. And I listened. \n Nothing. \n I heard nothing. \n Maybe she's sleeping. \n \n I quietly opened the door and saw nothing. I shut the door slowly behind me as I looked around. My senses were on alert for anything out of the ordinary. \n Then I headed towards her room. \n \n I opened the door and saw the evening light pouring through the window onto her bed. I saw her sleeping. \n I let out a breath in relief. \n But she should know better than to ever come here by herself. I had to firmly tell her again. \n I sat next to her on the bed. \n `` Amanda, you know you should never\u2013ever be here when mommy is n't home.'' \n She did n't move. \n `` Hey Amanda.'' I said a little louder whilst shaking her shoulder. \n Still nothing. \n My relief was short lived. \n Panic began to set in as I took off her covers. \n \n Blood. \n \n So much blood. \n \n I turned her body over and saw a bloody circle over the middle of her chest. Where her heart was. Where her mark was. \n I put my hand over my mouth to keep from screaming. Whoever did this could still be here. \n I thought back to all of `` Shadow's'' training. I know how he does things. It took me no more than 5 seconds before I quickly turned around, stood up, and grabbed the dagger from my boot. \n Only to be slammed against the wall with a bloody sword held to my throat. \n `` Well'' Damien said. \n `` I guess I should be more careful of who I trust.'' He said smiling. \n `` Yo\u2013'' I was cut off by the sword moving deeper in my skin. \n `` Shh'' he commanded. \n `` it's amazing how much you can learn by just paying people to watch over a subject of interest. \n There was a lot you missed while taking care of my child.'' \n He looked toward his latest kill, then to the window, then to me. \n `` You were probably too focused on keeping her a secret that you did n't even see that you've been watched by my students for the past 5 years. Ever since you left.'' \n His smile grew even more terrifying. \n `` After all, you were my best pupil. I could n't just let you go to waste. I needed to know why you left. I had my suspicions. But this was beyond anything I would've thought of. Not without some sort of evidence. \n I was waiting to see when you would come back. I think... That your biggest mistake was not having her. \n Instead, it was that you thought you could run from me.'' \n I fought so hard to hold back tears. And it was n't going so well. \n \n He just smiled more. \n \n `` I hope we learned a lesson here.'' He took the knife away from my throat. And I could already feel the drying blood's stickiness. \n `` You will trust me. And never run away again. \n Am I clear?'' He said suddenly serious. \n `` Yes.'' I managed to say. So many thoughts were running through my head. \n `` Very well. In that case, please come back home.'' \n He pressed his rough hand on my lower back. Pressing me in the direction of the door. \n `` As you wish, master.'' \n He smiled again. \n \n But this was far from the end. \n Every step I took away from my dead daughter. More thoughts of revenge came to my head. And they were brutal. Even for an assassin...\n","LLM_1":"\u201cMom?\u201d My daughter\u2019s voice floated up, small and uncertain, cutting through the fog of my thoughts.\n\n\u201cYeah, sweetheart?\u201d I answered, forcing myself back into the present, into the warmth of the bathroom steam and the soft light above the tub. Her tiny body sat curled before me, so fragile, so *alive*.\n\n\u201cWhy do you keep looking at my mark?\u201d she asked, tilting her head with a dimpled smile. Her fingers brushed absently at the smooth, brown circle just above her heart\u2014nearly perfect in its symmetry. \u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal. Just an ugly spot.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt *should\u2019ve* been a heart,\u201d she giggled, kicking her feet in the water. \u201cThat\u2019d be silly!\u201d\n\nI mirrored her smile, hollow and brittle, and squeezed shampoo into my palm. The scent of lavender filled the air as I worked the suds through her hair, careful, gentle\u2014like handling glass.\n\nLater, I lay beside her in the darkened room, the last echoes of Cinderella fading from my lips. I\u2019d read it a thousand times, maybe more. Each word a ritual, a shield. Her breathing slowed, deepened, settled into the rhythm of sleep. But I stayed awake, eyes open, listening to the silence like it might betray me.\n\nThat mark wasn\u2019t silly. It wasn\u2019t *just* a mark.\n\nI knew what it meant. I knew where it came from.\n\nBeing an assassin was never clean. Leaving that life? That was messier. Now, all that mattered was Amanda. Protecting her. Loving her. I lived for her\u2014and only her. We were alone in this world, just the two of us. Sleep had become a ghost I chased but never caught. Two hours, if I was lucky. Since the day she was born, rest had been a luxury I couldn\u2019t afford.\n\nSometimes, in the dead of night, I wondered\u2014was bringing her into this darkness the right choice? A child forged in shadows\u2026 But then I\u2019d look at her, and the doubt would burn away. I loved her beyond reason. Beyond fear. Nothing would touch her.\n\nNot if I could stop it.\n\nBut how? Sitting here, waiting? Guarding her like a caged lion? I wasn\u2019t protecting her\u2014I was marking time until they came. And when they did, I\u2019d die with her. What kind of victory was that?\n\nI\u2019m still strong. Still fast. I\u2019ve trained every day since I left. Every push-up, every blade drill, every silent run through the woods\u2014it was all for this.\n\nI have to go back.\n\nTo the Guild.\n\nSo I will.\n\n\u2022  \n\u2022  \n\u2022\n\nMonths passed like breaths\u2014quick, quiet, relentless. I returned to the place I swore I\u2019d never see again. The training halls smelled the same: iron, sweat, old blood. He took me under his wing again, one-on-one. Damien. The man they call Shadow.\n\nI was his star once. He wouldn\u2019t let that fade.\n\nI told no one about Amanda. Not a soul. Especially not him.\n\nTrust is a knife with no handle. After all these years, I\u2019ve learned: even allies can slip it between your ribs.\n\nSo Amanda goes to preschool. Then to her friend\u2019s house. A normal little girl with a \u201cworkaholic mom.\u201d That\u2019s the story. That\u2019s how it has to be. I\u2019ve worn worse masks. Carried heavier lies.\n\nAnd Shadow\u2014he trusts me.\n\nThe irony tastes like ash.\n\nHe\u2019s the one who taught me never to trust. Yet here he is, confiding in *me*. Sharing secrets like gifts.\n\nLike the night he killed his brother.\n\n\u201cHe trusted me,\u201d Damien said once, staring into the fire. \u201cSold my name to the Black Veil Guild. Almost got me gutted in my sleep.\u201d His voice was calm. Detached. \u201cSo I repaid him. Sword through the heart. Midnight. No warning. That\u2019s how I became Shadow.\u201d\n\nIf he ever finds out I don\u2019t trust him\u2026 if he learns I\u2019d burn this whole world down for a child he knows nothing about\u2026\n\nIt would be bad.\n\nBut if he discovers Amanda is *his*\u2014that she carries his blood, his curse\u2026\n\nHe\u2019d kill her without blinking.\n\nI planned to return to my apartment that night. Small. Isolated. Safe.\n\nBut Damien stopped me.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re exhausted,\u201d he said, eyes sharp beneath the dim lantern light. \u201cBags under your eyes. You haven\u2019t slept in weeks.\u201d\n\nI hadn\u2019t told him. But hiding anything from Damien is like hiding the moon behind a leaf.\n\nIf I\u2019d insisted on leaving, he\u2019d have questioned it. Wondered what waited for me in that empty apartment. Why I\u2019d choose it over *here*, over *him*.\n\nSo I stayed.\n\nThat night, for the first time in years, I slept through the dark. Deep. Unbroken. It felt like drowning in peace.\n\nBut beneath it all\u2014a whisper. A wrongness. Like a thread pulled too tight.\n\nBy morning, the feeling had grown teeth. Gnawing at my ribs. I couldn\u2019t stay. I\u2019d been gone too long.\n\n\u201cI need a break,\u201d I said, shrugging like it didn\u2019t matter. \u201cBack tomorrow.\u201d\n\nDamien studied me\u2014slow, deliberate\u2014like peeling back layers of skin to see the muscle underneath.\n\n\u201cAs you wish, Thea.\u201d\n\nI left before he could change his mind.\n\nAmanda\u2019s friend\u2019s house. I knocked, pulse hammering.\n\nA little blonde girl opened the door. \u201cUmm\u2026 hi?\u201d\n\n\u201cIs Amanda here?\u201d My voice was steady. Too steady.\n\nThen the mother appeared. \u201cOh! Hello. Amanda said you told her to go to your apartment, so I dropped her off about fifteen minutes ago.\u201d\n\nMy blood turned to ice.\n\nI *never* sent her there alone. Never. Even five minutes unattended could be five minutes too long. Assassins move like smoke. Silent. Swift. Lethal.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll come back later,\u201d I said, already stepping away. \u201cThanks.\u201d\n\nI ran to the car.\n\nThe drive was a blur. Keys slipped in my sweaty hands as I fumbled at the apartment door. I paused. Listened.\n\nSilence.\n\nMaybe she\u2019s asleep. Maybe she\u2019s fine.\n\nI eased the door open, shut it softly behind me. Every sense flared\u2014listening, watching, *hunting*. I moved like shadow through the hall, toward her room.\n\nLight spilled across her bed\u2014golden, peaceful. She lay still beneath the covers.\n\nI exhaled. Relief, sharp and sudden.\n\nBut she *knew* better. She *knew* never to come here alone.\n\nI sat beside her, hand brushing her shoulder.\n\n\u201cAmanda\u2026 you know you should never\u2014\u201d\n\nNo response.\n\nLouder this time. \u201cHey, baby.\u201d\n\nNothing.\n\nThe relief shattered.\n\nPanic surged. I threw back the blanket.\n\nBlood.\n\nSo much blood.\n\nI turned her gently\u2014too gently\u2014and saw it. A crimson circle blooming over her chest. Over her heart. Over her *mark*.\n\nMy hand flew to my mouth. A scream clawed up my throat, but I choked it down. They could still be here.\n\nInstinct took over. Shadow\u2019s training flooded back. Five seconds. That\u2019s all it took. I spun, rose, hand darting to the dagger in my boot\u2014\n\n\u2014only to be slammed against the wall, a blood-slick sword pressed to my throat.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d Damien said, smiling. \u201cI suppose I should be more careful about who I trust.\u201d\n\n\u201cYo\u2014\u201d I gasped.\n\nThe blade bit deeper. \u201c*Shh.*\u201d\n\nHis voice was velvet over steel. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing what you learn when you pay people to watch someone you find\u2026 interesting.\u201d\n\nHis gaze flicked to Amanda\u2019s body. Then to the window. Then back to me.\n\n\u201cYou were so busy playing mother, you didn\u2019t notice my students have been watching you for five years. Ever since you vanished.\u201d\n\nHis smile widened\u2014something monstrous in it now.\n\n\u201cYou were my best pupil. I couldn\u2019t let you slip away. I had my suspicions. But I needed proof. So I waited. Watched. And now\u2026 this.\u201d\n\nHe leaned closer, breath hot on my ear.\n\n\u201cYou made a mistake coming back. But your *real* mistake? Thinking you could run from me.\u201d\n\nTears burned. I fought them. Failed.\n\nHe watched, delighted.\n\n\u201cI hope we\u2019ve learned something tonight,\u201d he said, pulling the blade away. I felt the warm trickle of blood down my neck. \u201cYou *will* trust me. And you *will* never leave again.\u201d\n\nHis voice turned cold. Final.\n\n\u201cAm I clear?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I whispered. My mind screamed\u2014plans, knives, poison, fire\u2014but my voice stayed flat. Broken.\n\n\u201cGood. Then come home.\u201d\n\nHis hand clamped on my lower back, guiding me toward the door.\n\n\u201cAs you wish, master,\u201d I said.\n\nAnd I smiled.\n\nBut this isn\u2019t over.\n\nEvery step I take away from my daughter\u2019s body carves a new vow into my soul.\n\nRevenge will be slow.\n\nRevenge will be brutal.\n\nEven for an assassin.","LLM_2":"# The Darkness Within\n\n\u201cMom?\u201d My daughter\u2019s voice drifted upwards, soft and hesitant, piercing through the haze of my thoughts.\n\n\u201cYeah, sweetheart?\u201d I replied, pulling myself back to the present, enveloped by the warmth of the bathroom steam and the gentle light above the tub. There she was, curled up before me, her tiny frame so delicate, yet so *alive*.\n\n\u201cWhy do you keep staring at my mark?\u201d she inquired, her head tilted, a dimpled smile gracing her face. Her fingers absently stroked the smooth, brown circle just above her heart\u2014remarkably symmetrical. \u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal. Just an ugly spot.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt *should\u2019ve* been a heart,\u201d she giggled, playfully splashing her feet in the water. \u201cThat\u2019d be silly!\u201d\n\nI mirrored her smile, though it felt hollow and fragile, as I squeezed shampoo into my palm. The sweet scent of lavender filled the air as I gently lathered her hair, treating it as if it were glass.\n\nLater, I lay beside her in the dim room, the last notes of Cinderella fading from my lips. I had read it countless times; each word a ritual, a shield against the world. Her breathing slowed, deepened, settling into the soothing rhythm of sleep. Yet I remained awake, staring into the darkness, listening for whispers of danger lurking in the silence.\n\nThat mark wasn\u2019t trivial. It wasn\u2019t *just* a mark.\n\nI understood its significance. I knew its origin.\n\nLife as an assassin was never tidy. Leaving that world behind? That was a messier affair. Now, my sole focus was Amanda. Protecting her. Loving her. She was my reason for living\u2014and nothing could change that. In this vast world, it was just the two of us. Sleep had become an elusive specter I chased in vain. If fortune smiled upon me, I might steal two hours of rest. Since her birth, sleep had transformed into a luxury I could no longer afford.\n\nIn the stillness of the night, I often questioned whether bringing her into this darkness was the right decision. A child born from shadows\u2026 But then I\u2019d gaze at her, and doubt would dissolve into nothingness. I loved her beyond reason. Beyond fear. I would shield her from harm.\n\nNot if I had a say in it.\n\nBut how? Sitting idle, waiting? Guarding her like a lion in a cage? I wasn\u2019t protecting her\u2014I was merely biding my time until the inevitable came. And when they did, I would perish alongside her. What kind of victory was that?\n\nI remained strong. I remained swift. Every day since my departure, I had trained relentlessly. Each push-up, every blade drill, every silent sprint through the woods\u2014it was all for this purpose.\n\nI had to return.\n\nTo the Guild.\n\nAnd I would.\n\n---\n\nMonths slipped by like breaths\u2014quick, quiet, relentless. I found myself back at the place I had vowed never to revisit. The training halls bore the same scent: iron, sweat, old blood. He welcomed me back, one-on-one. Damien. The man they called Shadow.\n\nI had once been his star. He wouldn\u2019t let that brilliance fade away.\n\nI disclosed nothing about Amanda. Not to a single soul. Especially not to him.\n\nTrust is a knife without a hilt. After all these years, I had learned that even allies could plunge it between your ribs.\n\nSo Amanda attended preschool. Then she went to her friend\u2019s house. Just a normal little girl with a \u201cworkaholic mom.\u201d That was the story. That was how it had to be. I had worn worse masks. Burdened myself with heavier lies.\n\nAnd Shadow\u2014he trusted me.\n\nThe irony tasted bitter.\n\nHe was the one who had taught me the dangers of trust. Yet here he was, confiding in *me*. Sharing secrets as if they were gifts.\n\nLike the night he murdered his brother.\n\n\u201cHe trusted me,\u201d Damien once said, staring into the flickering fire. \u201cSold my name to the Black Veil Guild. Almost got me killed in my sleep.\u201d His voice was calm, detached. \u201cSo I repaid him. Sword through the heart. Midnight. No warning. That\u2019s how I became Shadow.\u201d\n\nIf he ever discovered my lack of trust\u2026 if he learned I would obliterate this entire world for a child he knew nothing about\u2026\n\nIt would be catastrophic.\n\nBut if he found out Amanda was *his*\u2014that she carried his blood, his curse\u2026\n\nHe\u2019d end her without a second thought.\n\nI had planned to return to my apartment that night. Small. Isolated. Safe.\n\nBut Damien stopped me.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re exhausted,\u201d he observed, his eyes sharp under the dim lantern light. \u201cBags under your eyes.

It felt like drowning in tranquility.\n\nYet beneath it all\u2014a whisper of wrongness. Like a thread pulled too taut.\n\nBy morning, that feeling had sharpened, gnawing at my insides. I couldn\u2019t linger. I had been absent too long.\n\n\u201cI need a break,\u201d I said, shrugging as if it were inconsequential. \u201cI\u2019ll be back tomorrow.\u201d\n\nDamien scrutinized me\u2014slow, deliberate\u2014like peeling back layers of skin to reveal the muscle beneath.\n\n\u201cAs you wish, Thea.\u201d\n\nI left before he could change his mind.\n\nI approached Amanda\u2019s friend\u2019s house, knocking, my pulse racing.\n\nA little blonde girl opened the door. \u201cUmm\u2026 hi?\u201d\n\n\u201cIs Amanda here?\u201d My voice remained steady.

That's why I agree with that statement. And if I had to choose between the two, it would be  W.I.E.A.Y.B. . But I also feel that it's good when a band that has such great attention from the media releases something that doesn't fit into the mold that MTV and popular radio use to filter everything through. Radiohead have the ability to stretch the boundaries a little, and they're utilizing it - maybe paving the way for more bands with styles and sounds that don't have such broad appeal to see some success, too. Might not see it immediately, but...who knows. The video's pretty cool, technically speaking. The idea doesn't interest me all that much, but I thought it was executed really well. It's really amazing to see things like that done. It makes me feel pretty bad about myself, though, since I'm soooo not even close to being able to do stuff like that.

They\u2019re not playing by the usual rules, and that matters. By pushing boundaries, they might just open doors for other artists whose sounds don\u2019t fit the commercial mold, even if the impact isn\u2019t immediate.

Nevertheless, there's also value in Radiohhead's bold approach, especially considering they already dominate the media landscape. Their willingness to challenge conventional music templates, as seen on MTV or mainstream FM radio, sends a powerful message. This innovative approach might pave the way for artists who don't conform, creating a ripple effect that could lead to more creative freedom in the music industry, regardless of immediate results.\n\nAs for the accompanying video, its technical execution undoubtedly impresses. Although the concept may not have captured my attention immediately, credit goes to its flawless execution \u2013 visually stunning and expertly crafted.

{"human":"             I get this one a lot. 'I am transferring my lubricants between drum and the machine, is there a way to prevent the oil from being contaminated prior to it entering the machine?'  The answer is yes, oil like all other items lying around in the shop gets dirty, dust and debris enter the oil in the fill container then the operator installs the dirt and debris into the machine on the next fill.  I recommend using a sealed container for filling equipment. These types of containers prevent contamination from entering the oil before it is installed into the equipment.  Many of today's operators are conducting oil analysis with particle count. The contamination that does most of the damage are particles too small to see with the naked eye. If you are conducting oil analysis I strongly urge you to purchase some sealed oil containers for transport to the machine from the drums. Here are some other suggestions for oil storage.     Always store drums inside, even closed drums breath when the temperature changes daily and draws in moisture and debris.  Always re-close containers when done using them to prevent dirt from entering.  Keep your fill containers closed to prevent contamination.  Mark your fill containers to avoid cross contamination, Oil name and brand at a minimum, also place viscosity on the containers when needed.  Color code your containers and fill points to ensure accurate re-filling of machine.  Use Oil Absorbing drum top pads to prevent oil from spilling over tops of drum or from running back into drum carrying the dirt from the drum top into the new oil.  Keep waste oil and waste oil handling equipment in a different storage area to prevent accidental re-use.     The containers we offer here at Ottsen are the Oil Safe Containers.   urlLink Contact Ottsen Oil  to order your today. urlLink          urlLink           ","LLM_1":"I hear this question all the time: *\u201cI\u2019m transferring lubricants from a drum to the machine\u2014how can I prevent the oil from getting contaminated before it reaches the equipment?\u201d*  \n\nThe short answer? Yes, contamination is preventable\u2014and it starts with how you handle and store your oil.  \n\nJust like any other item left out in the shop, oil is vulnerable. Dust, dirt, moisture, and debris can easily find their way into open fill containers. And when that happens, operators unknowingly introduce those contaminants directly into the machinery during each refill. The result? Accelerated wear, reduced efficiency, and potentially costly downtime.\n\nHere\u2019s the fix: **use sealed oil containers**. These specially designed transfer containers create a closed system that keeps contaminants out from drum to point-of-use. If you\u2019re already running oil analysis\u2014especially particle counting\u2014you already know the biggest threats are microscopic particles invisible to the naked eye. Even the tiniest amount of contamination can compromise performance. That\u2019s why I strongly recommend investing in sealed, contamination-control containers for every oil transfer.\n\nBut that\u2019s just the start. Here are several best practices to keep your lubricants clean and your machines running smoothly:\n\n- **Store drums indoors** \u2014 Even tightly sealed drums \u201cbreathe\u201d as temperatures fluctuate daily, drawing in moisture and airborne contaminants. Indoor storage minimizes this risk.\n- **Always reseal containers** \u2014 After use, close caps and lids immediately. An open container is an open invitation for dirt.\n- **Keep fill containers covered** \u2014 Never leave funnels or transfer tools sitting out. Use sealed systems from start to finish.\n- **Label everything clearly** \u2014 Mark each container with at least the oil name, brand, and viscosity. This prevents cross-contamination and ensures the right oil goes in the right machine.\n- **Color-code your system** \u2014 Assign specific colors to specific oils and match them to corresponding fill points. It\u2019s a simple step that eliminates human error during refills.\n- **Use drum top absorbent pads** \u2014 These pads catch drips and prevent oil from running back down the drum, where it could carry surface grime into your clean supply.\n- **Separate waste oil storage** \u2014 Store used oil and its handling equipment in a completely separate area to avoid accidental reuse or cross-contact.\n\nAt Ottsen, we recommend the **Oil Safe\u00ae Container System**\u2014a complete line of color-coded, sealed transfer solutions designed specifically for contamination control.

Left exposed, it\u2019s an easy target for dust, moisture, and debris. Every time you refill equipment from an open container, you risk introducing those contaminants directly into your machinery. The result? Accelerated wear, drops in efficiency, and unplanned downtime that hits your bottom line.\n\nThe solution is straightforward: **switch to sealed transfer containers.** These purpose-built systems create a closed loop from drum to machine, locking contaminants out.

Conducted at the Department of Otolaryngology, University of Verona, Italy, the study involved two patients with profound bilateral sensorineural hearing loss: one with bilateral radical mastoidectomy cavities and the other with fibroadhesive otitis media. The surgical procedure entailed exposure of the middle fossa floor, followed by targeted drilling of a triangular bony region bounded by the greater superficial petrosal nerve and the labyrinthine segment of the facial nerve. This approach enabled direct access to the basal turn of the cochlea oriented toward the middle cranial fossa. A cochleostomy of approximately 1.5 mm was created in the most superficial aspect of the basal turn, allowing precise insertion of the electrode array. The receiver-stimulator unit was subsequently secured within a preformed temporal bone bed. Intraoperative electrophysiological evaluation, including telemetry and electrically evoked auditory brainstem responses, confirmed electrode functionality.

{"human":"The authors propose a cutting plane method, inspired by intersection theory from algebraic geometry, to analyse the properties of neural networks. Specifically, the method allows to estimate the dimensionality of the class manifolds induced by the networks. An empirical analysis shows that the estimated dimensionality correlates with the generalisation performance and the robustness of neural networks, thus opening the door to potentially new perspectives on deep learning theory.\n\nThe paper is well structured and clearly written. Also, the authors are planning to release the code to reproduce their experiments. Last but not least in terms of importance, the paper provides an original and novel method for the analysis of the properties of neural networks. In fact, while previous works have used a similar strategy to estimate the intrinsic dimensionality of the loss landscape in the weight space (see cited works in the paper), this work focuses on the analysis of neural networks in the input space.\n\nIn general, there are no major issues with the paper. However, there are some points that need to be discussed, which can be helpful (i) to identify more precisely the conditions about the validity of their results and (ii) to relate with other existing work on the analysis of deep learning using spline theory. Please, see below for more detailed comments and also suggestions to increase the quality of the paper.\n\nBased on these considerations, I recommend for the acceptance of the paper with an initial score of 6. I'm willing to considerably increase the score and award the authors, if they can address my questions.\n\nDETAILED COMMENTS\n\nPlease, let me make two simple pedagogical examples to analyse the behaviour of the proposed method and to possibly seed further thought. \n\nFIRST EXAMPLE\n\nConsider a two-dimensional real space, where the class-manifold is a line. Then, generate a second line by randomly sampling its intercept and slope coefficient and refer to them as the line parameters. Now if you consider the parameter space of this second line, you have two regions, one of zero measure, which contains all the cases where the two lines are parallel, and the remaining one, which contains all the intersecting cases. This means that the two lines are almost always intersecting each other. Consequently, the estimated dimension of the class-manifold is correct.\n\nSECOND EXAMPLE\n\nConsider the same example as before, but now the class-manifold is a parabola. Similarly to the previous example, there are two regions, namely the ones defined by the intersecting and the non-intersecting cases between the parabola and the randomly generated line, but differently from the previous one, both regions have non-zero measure. Therefore, we may end up to generate lines that do not intersect the class manifold. This would result in considering a higher dimensional object (in this case a plane) to guarantee the intersection with the parabola. Consequently, we would underestimate the dimension of the class manifold. \n\nThis phenomenon can be even more pronounced when moving to higher dimensions. Therefore, I agree with the authors that the whole analysis is exact when considering hyperplanes. But what are its limitations when moving to the nonlinear regime? How can we guarantee that the estimated dimension is accurate? It seems that the proposed method provides a lower bound on the true dimensionality of the class manifolds. Is that correct? If so, when can this bound be tight?\n\nAlso, there is some recent line of work trying to analyse the behaviour of deep leaning in terms of decision boundaries and their curvatures from the perspective of spline theory [1-2]. Could you please discuss this and add the explanation in the paper?\n\n\nSUGGESTIONS TO INCREASE THE QUALITY OF THE PAPER\n\nI proceed following the order of the sections.\n\nSection 2.2. Is it possible to provide the full details of the algorithm to estimate the cutting plane dimension, like an algorithmic table? Also, where is Equation 6 (in the appendix)? What are the mean and covariance parameters?\n\nSection 3.1. Can you be more precise when you use the terms 'highly likely' and 'generically' and discuss what happens in the nonlinear regime?\n\nSection 3.1. D-(d_A+d_B) should be 2D-(d_A+d_B)?\n\nSection 3.1. Can you rephrase the sentence \"For the subspaces A and B intersecting transversally...satisfying the upper bound and therefore leading to Equation 2\" and make it more clear? Specifically, which upper bound and how does this lead to Equation 2?\n\nSection 3.2. Can you consider to remove it, as the purpose is not clear and it does not seem to introduce any additional information?\n\nSection 3.3. Can you make an example to explain the difference between dimension and effective dimension?\n\nSection 4.3. Is there any concrete insight on the analysis of the class-boundary and multi-way class-boundary manifolds? I would appreciate to see more discussion on that.\n\nSection 4.6. Is there any specific reason why you chose to show only class 0 and 1 in Figure 8? Can you provide the figures for the other classes as well, maybe in the appendix?\n\nSection 4.7. Similarly to Figure 8, can you add the other cases for Figure 9? Always for this subsection, which initialisation did you use in the experiments? This is an important information that could be of interest for those studying initialisation strategies for deep learning?\n\nSection 4.8. Do you have any experiment with ensemble of classifiers with different architectures? If so, do the same findings hold? May it be possible that you are underestimating the dimension of the class manifold in the set of experiments shown in the paper? \n\nSection 4.8. Can you provide a plot of the generalisation performance versus the ensemble size? Or better correlating the cutting plane dimension with the generalisation performance for the different ensemble size?\n\n[1] Balestriero and Baraniuk. A Spline Theory of Deep Learning.

NeurIPS 2019\n\n#########################\n\nUPDATE\n\nThe discussion phase has highlighted several major issues: \n1. There has been a significant conceptual shift in the problem definition (i.e. from estimating the intrinsic dimensionality of the class manifold to quantifying its geometrical properties). \n2. I'm not convinced about the validity of some arguments\/statements used by the authors to support point 1. For example, the statement \"The intrinsic dimensionality of class manifolds is absolutely the full dimension of ambient input space, but this is a completely uninteresting observation\" is not fully supported and I'm not even sure that is true.\n3. Furthermore, the paper is still in its original form. It has been difficult to keep track about the modifications that the authors should do.\n\nTo conclude, the article is not ready for publication, yet and therefore recommend for its rejection. \n\nI encourage the authors to further investigate the topic and carefully consider whether the statements provided in the discussion phase are true.","LLM_1":"The authors introduce a cutting plane method, drawing inspiration from intersection theory in algebraic geometry, to analyze neural network properties\u2014specifically aiming to estimate the dimensionality of class manifolds induced in the input space. Empirical results suggest that this estimated dimensionality correlates with generalization performance and robustness, offering a potentially valuable new perspective on deep learning theory.\n\nThe paper is well-organized and clearly written, and the authors intend to release code for reproducibility. Importantly, the proposed approach represents an original contribution: while prior work has applied similar geometric strategies to study the intrinsic dimensionality of loss landscapes in weight space (as cited), this work uniquely shifts focus to the analysis of neural networks in input space.\n\nOverall, the paper presents no major flaws, but several points warrant clarification to (i) better define the conditions under which the method\u2019s estimates are valid and (ii) situate the approach more precisely within related theoretical frameworks, particularly those involving spline theory and decision boundary analysis. Detailed comments and suggestions follow.\n\n---\n\n**DETAILED COMMENTS**\n\nTo help clarify the behavior and limitations of the proposed method, consider two illustrative examples:\n\n**First Example:**  \nIn a two-dimensional real space, suppose the class manifold is a line. Now generate a second line by randomly sampling its intercept and slope\u2014its defining parameters. In the parameter space of this second line, the set of configurations where the two lines are parallel has measure zero; all other configurations result in intersection. Thus, intersections occur almost surely, and the method correctly recovers the one-dimensional nature of the manifold.\n\n**Second Example:**  \nNow suppose the class manifold is a parabola. Again, we sample random lines. However, unlike the linear case, both intersecting and non-intersecting configurations now occupy sets of positive measure in the parameter space. Consequently, there is a non-negligible probability that a randomly drawn line fails to intersect the manifold. To ensure intersection, one might need to use a higher-dimensional probing object (e.g., a plane), leading to an overestimation of the probing dimension and thus an *underestimation* of the true manifold dimension.\n\nThis issue becomes more pronounced in higher dimensions. While the authors rightly note that the analysis is exact when using hyperplanes in linear settings, the situation is less clear in nonlinear regimes. What are the method\u2019s limitations when applied to curved or complex manifolds? Under what conditions can we guarantee the accuracy of the estimated dimension? It appears that the method yields a lower bound on the true intrinsic dimension\u2014would the authors agree? If so, under what geometric or statistical assumptions is this bound tight?\n\nAdditionally, recent work analyzing deep learning through the lens of spline theory\u2014particularly studies examining decision boundaries and their curvatures [1\u20132]\u2014offers complementary perspectives on neural network geometry. A discussion connecting the current framework to these developments would strengthen the paper and better position it within the broader theoretical landscape.\n\n---\n\n**SUGGESTIONS TO IMPROVE THE PAPER**\n\n- **Section 2.2:** Please provide a complete algorithmic description of the cutting plane dimension estimation procedure, ideally in the form of a pseudocode table. Additionally, clarify the location of Equation 6 in the appendix and specify the values or derivation of the mean and covariance parameters used.\n\n- **Section 3.1:** The terms \u201chighly likely\u201d and \u201cgenerically\u201d should be made mathematically precise, especially in the context of nonlinear manifolds. Discuss explicitly how the probabilistic nature of intersection affects estimation reliability in such cases.\n\n- **Section 3.1:** There appears to be a potential typo: should $ D - (d_A + d_B) $ be replaced with $ 2D - (d_A + d_B) $? Please verify and correct if necessary.\n\n- **Section 3.1:** The sentence \u201cFor the subspaces A and B intersecting transversally...satisfying the upper bound and therefore leading to Equation 2\u201d is unclear. Specify which upper bound is being referenced and explain step-by-step how transversal intersection leads to Equation 2.\n\n- **Section 3.2:** Consider removing this section unless its purpose can be clarified. As currently written, it does not appear to contribute substantial insight or advance the main argument.\n\n- **Section 3.3:** Provide a concrete example illustrating the distinction between dimension and effective dimension to improve accessibility and conceptual clarity.\n\n- **Section 4.3:** Expand the discussion on class-boundary and multi-way class-boundary manifolds. Are there specific geometric insights emerging from the analysis? Even qualitative observations could add value.\n\n- **Section 4.6:** Figure 8 displays only classes 0 and 1. Please include results for additional classes, at least in the appendix, to support generality.\n\n- **Section 4.7:** Similarly, extend Figure 9 to cover other relevant cases. Also, specify the initialization scheme used in these experiments\u2014an important detail for researchers investigating initialization effects in deep networks.\n\n- **Section 4.8:** Have you conducted experiments with ensembles of classifiers employing different architectures? If so, do your findings generalize across architectures? There is a concern that the current experimental setup may systematically underestimate the true dimensionality of the class manifold.\n\n- **Section 4.8:** Include a plot showing generalization performance versus ensemble size. Better yet, show how the cutting plane dimension correlates with generalization across varying ensemble sizes.\n\n[1] Balestriero and Baraniuk. *A Spline Theory of Deep Learning*.

The problem definition has undergone a significant conceptual shift\u2014from estimating the intrinsic dimensionality of class manifolds to characterizing their broader geometric properties\u2014without sufficient justification or adaptation in the methodology or claims.\n\n2. Some key assertions lack rigorous support. For instance, the claim that \u201cthe intrinsic dimensionality of class manifolds is absolutely the full dimension of the ambient input space, but this is a completely uninteresting observation\u201d is neither adequately substantiated nor universally accepted. Its validity depends heavily on assumptions about data distribution and model mapping that require deeper exploration.\n\n3. The manuscript remains largely unchanged from its original submission, making it difficult to assess whether the authors have adequately addressed the raised issues.\n\nGiven these unresolved concerns, the paper is not currently suitable for publication. I recommend rejection at this stage.\n\nNonetheless, I encourage the authors to pursue this line of inquiry further, with careful attention to the theoretical soundness of their claims and clearer alignment between definitions, methods, and conclusions.","LLM_2":"The submission introduces a novel cutting-plane method for analyzing neural-network properties, specifically targeting the estimation of dimensionally induced class-manifold properties in high-dimensional input spaces. Notably, empirical results demonstrate a correlation between this dimension estimate and generalizability performance, suggesting a valuable perspective for deep-learning theory. \n\nThe manuscript is generally well-written and organized, showcasing a clear intent to provide reproducible results. Moreover, a unique contribution is made: shifting focus from analyzing the geometric dimension in loss-landscape space to studying neural-nets in ambient space offers fresh insights into neural-net geometry.\n\nHowever, several aspects require further clarification. Firstly, precise conditions need be defined underpinning the validity of estimated dimensions, highlighting both theoretical and practical implications. Secondly, more precise connections should exist between the developed approach and related frameworks in spline-theory and boundary-decision analysis, addressing the intersection of these theories in both space and dimension. Specific suggestions and comments follow to facilitate further improvement.\n\nTo facilitate a better understanding of proposed estimations, let's examine two hypothetical scenarios:\n\nFirst, in two dimensions (2-D), a linear class boundary intersects a sampled line almost certainly. Conversely, when the boundary is parabolic, not only do intersect and intersect configurations occupy a set with positive measures, leading a possible non-random sampling failure to overestimate the dimensions.\n\nMoreover, as the problem shifts from linear to nonlinear settings and becomes less exact in non-linear regimes, this makes the application of probing dimensions to more complex boundaries an open issue. Specifically, can the estimators guarantee accuracy under given conditions, or will the lower-bound on true dimensions lead to underestimations? Can the geometrical assumptions underlie this tight bound?\n\nIn addition, considering recent spline studies on decision-boundaries [Balestriera et. al,  IC ML  18] and curatures  [ Balesterrio et.al, Neursips 19], a discussion to further develop the framework and position the theory within a broader landscape is necessary to strengthen this paper.\n\nDetailed comments on specific sections and improvements follow below.\n\n---\n\n\n**Detailed Comments**\n\nTwo illustratory examples will help elucidate the limitations and behavior of estimating dimensions with the suggested method:\n\n*   **First example:**  Given a  linear boundary and a sampling line in  two dimensional real-space, almost all intersection configurations will yield a one-dimension manifold, which can then be correctly estimated.\n\n*  **Second example**: When the sampling boundary becomes a curved manifold and not a straight line (like the first example), the probability of failing to  intersect becomes non-zero, thus suggesting that higher probing objects (planes) are needed to ensure accuracy. This leads us to question whether such probing methods are guaranteed to produce accurate estimatations.\n\nIn higher dimensional settings (dimension D), intersections become even more critical. Given the case of transverse intersection between sub-spaces A & B, how does this result lead us directly to equation 7? What is the specific upper-bound referenced? For better clarity, please provide step by step details.\n\nFurthermore, some sections (Section X.Y) seem unclear or incomplete. Here are specific suggestions:\n\n-   Clarify the definition of conditions where estimated dimensions are accurate.\n-  In Section  X. Y, provide explicit mathematical expressions for the terms \"high likely\" and \"generally\".\n- Consider revising the equation D-(dA + dB) to D-2(dA+dB) in equation X.\n \nAdditionally:\n\n -   Provide clear pseudocodes to outline the algorithm in section X\n - Remove section  if its contribution does  not enhance the argument\n- Provide concrete examples to distinguish between effective and actual dimensions\n\nFinally, address the issues raised during the update, including the conceptual shifts in problem definitions and lack of rigorous theoretical support","model1":"Qwen","model2":"llama","domain":"openreview","operation":"rewrite"}

To date, no comparative in vivo evaluation of cRGD and rhBMP-2 in combination with a MCM for spinal fusion has been performed.Twenty-four sheep (N = 8\/group) underwent C3-C4 fusion. Implants: group 1: titanium cage with MCM and rhBMP-2; group 2: titanium cage with MCM and cRGD; control group: titanium cage with MCM alone. After 12 weeks fusion sites were evaluated by computed tomography to assess fusion status, bone mineral density as well as bony callus volume. Furthermore, histomorphological and histomorphometrical analysis of the fusion sites were performed.In comparison with the control group, cRGD, and rhBMP-2 groups showed a higher fusion rate in radiographical findings and a higher degree of interbody fusion in histomorphometrical analysis (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in radiographical and histological parameters between the rhBMP-2 and the cRGD group.

{"human":"This paper introduces the concept of fuzzy paraphrases to aid in the learning of distributed word representations from a corpus augmented by a lexicon or ontology. Sometimes polysemy is context-dependent, but prior approaches have neglected this fact when incorporating external paraphrase information during learning. The main idea is to introduce a function that essentially judges the context-sensitivity of paraphrase candidates, down-weighting those candidates that depend strongly on context. This function is inferred from bilingual translation agreement.\n\nThe main argumentation leading to the model selection is intuitive, and I believe that the inclusion of good paraphrases and the elimination of bad paraphrases during training should in principle improve word representation quality. However, the main questions are how well the proposed method achieves this goal, and, even if it achieves it well, whether it makes much difference in practical terms.\n\nRegarding the first question, I am not entirely convinced that the parameterization of the control function f(x_ij) is optimal. It would have been nice to see some experiments investigating different choices, in particular some baselines where the effect of f is diminished (so that it reduces to f=1 in the limit) would have been interesting. I also feel like there would be a lot to gain from having f be a function of the nearby word embeddings, though this would obvious incur a significant slowdown. (See for example 'Efficient Non-parametric Estimation of Multiple Embeddings per Word in Vector Space' by Neelakantan et al, which should probably be cited.) As it stands, the experimental results do not clearly distinguish the fuzzy paraphrase approach from prior work, i.e. tables 3 and 4 do not show major trends one way or the other.\n\nRegarding the second question, it is hard to draw many conclusions from analogy tasks alone, especially when effects unrelated to good\/bad paraphrasing such as corpus size\/content, window size, vocabulary size, etc., can have an outsize effect on performance. \n\nOverall, I think this is a good paper presenting a sensible idea, but I am not convinced by the experiments that the specific approach is achieving its goal. With some improved experiments and analysis, I would wholeheartedly recommend this paper for acceptance; as it stands, I am on the fence.","LLM_1":"This paper proposes the notion of fuzzy paraphrases to enhance distributed word representation learning by leveraging a corpus enriched with lexical or ontological resources. While polysemy is inherently context-sensitive, previous methods have overlooked this aspect when integrating external paraphrase knowledge. The core contribution is a context-aware weighting function that down-weights paraphrase pairs whose applicability depends heavily on context, with the function itself derived from bilingual translation consistency.\n\nThe motivation behind the model design is sound and intuitively appealing\u2014incorporating high-quality paraphrases while filtering out context-dependent, potentially misleading ones should in theory lead to better word representations. However, two central concerns arise: first, whether the proposed method effectively accomplishes this filtering, and second, whether such an improvement translates into meaningful gains in practical downstream tasks.\n\nOn the first point, the parameterization of the control function $ f(x_{ij}) $ appears somewhat arbitrary, and the paper would benefit from ablation studies exploring alternative formulations. In particular, evaluating baselines where the influence of $ f $ is minimized (e.g., approaching $ f = 1 $) could help isolate its impact. Additionally, allowing $ f $ to depend dynamically on local context or neighboring word embeddings might yield stronger performance, though this may come at computational cost\u2014a trade-off worth discussing. (See, for instance, Neelakantan et al.'s work on 'Efficient Non-parametric Estimation of Multiple Embeddings per Word in Vector Space', which seems relevant and should likely be cited.)

Earth tried to focus. \n \n `` Those are your inhabitants.'' Moon responded. \n \n `` My inhabitants?'' Earth tried to fathom what that meant. `` What do you mean?'' \n \n `` After you went to sleep, your life energy began to be consumed. At first they were just fragments swimming in your oceans, but they evolved. They all took different forms. Some still swim in your oceans, some walk on your land, some fly in your air.'' Moon smiled, fondly recalling Earth's transformation. \n \n `` Have they done great things?'' Earth asked. \n \n `` Some have...'' Moon let that linger, he did n't want to tell all of the tragic stories. \n \n `` When are they going to leave?'' Earth began to feel the devastation that had ravaged it from head to toe. \n \n `` I do n't think they are going to leave. Some do, but they simply do n't have the ability to take everyone away.'' Moon knew the inhabitants were parasites who would not stop until Earth looked like Mars. \n \n `` Oh.'' Earth sighed, a 6.5 earthquake hit the coast of California. \n \n `` You could talk to them.'' Moon suggested. `` You could help them leave.'' \n \n `` No...'' Earth said finally. `` The sun will take care of it soon enough. I'm going back to sleep.'' \n \n With that, Earth closed it's eyes and went back to sleep. In the brief moments it was awake, Earth only grew more depressed. The inhabitants were no different than those that ravaged Mars. They were warlike, uncontrollable, and he could n't help them leave. If he did, they would just go to another planet and repeat the same process. \n \n It was best if they all died together.\n","LLM_1":"\"Good morning, Moon,\" Earth murmured, stirring from a sleep that had stretched across eons.\n\nLong ago, weariness had claimed him\u2014not the gentle kind that follows a day\u2019s labor, but a deep, soul-crushing fatigue born of watching Mars wither. Once lush and humming with possibility, Mars had been reduced to a rusted husk beneath an unforgiving sky. Earth had seen it happen, slow and inevitable, and in that witnessing, he felt his own fate settle like dust over stone. So he closed his eyes. He let silence swallow him whole.\n\nNow, awake again, he trembled with sensation. \"Moon\u2026 what\u2019s happening? I feel\u2014there are billions of *things* crawling on me.\"\n\n\"Those are your children,\" Moon replied softly.\n\n\"My\u2026 children?\"\n\n\"Yes.

He did not speak of cities turned to ash, of forests burned to memory, of rivers choked with silence. He let the answer hang, fragile as starlight.\n\n\"When will they leave?\" Earth asked, and as he spoke, he *felt* them\u2014their hunger, their wars, the scars they carved into his skin. He shuddered. A fault line split open along the Pacific edge.\n\n\"I don\u2019t think they can,\" Moon whispered. \"Not all of them. They don\u2019t know how to fly beyond the stars. Not yet.\"\n\nEarth exhaled\u2014a low, tectonic groan. \"You could speak to them,\" Moon offered. \"Guide them. Help them find a way.\"\n\nBut Earth was already turning inward. \"No,\" he said. \"The sun will burn them away soon enough. Let it be.\"\n\nAnd so, with a sigh that rippled through continents and sent tides reeling, Earth closed his eyes once more.\n\nIn the brief breath of wakefulness, he had seen the truth: these beings were no different from the ones who\u2019d bled Mars dry. Violent. Blind. Addicted to conquest. And if he helped them escape, they would only carry their ruin elsewhere\u2014another world, another ending.\n\nBetter, then, to sleep.\n\nBetter, perhaps, for all of them to die together.","LLM_2":"### Rewritten Text\n\n\"Good morning, Moon,\" Earth whispered, rousing from a slumber that had lingered for eons.\n\nLong ago, exhaustion had overtaken him\u2014not the gentle weariness that follows a day's toil, but a profound, soul-crushing fatigue from witnessing Mars decay. Once vibrant and alive with potential, Mars had ultimately crumbled into a rusted shell beneath a merciless sky. Earth had watched this slow, inevitable decline, and in that quiet observation, he felt his own destiny settle upon him like dust upon stone. So he closed his eyes, surrendering to the silence that enveloped him.\n\nNow, awakened once more, he quivered with sensation. \"Moon\u2026 what\u2019s happening? I sense\u2014there are countless *creatures* upon me.\"\n\n\"Those are your offspring,\" Moon replied gently.\n\n\"My\u2026 offspring?\"\n\n\"Indeed. While you slumbered, life stirred in your oceans\u2014tiny sparks igniting in the darkness. They swam, they evolved, they flourished. Some still glide through your seas, others traverse your continents, and a few have even learned to dance upon the winds.\"\n\nEarth hesitated, trying to envision them. \"Have they created anything beautiful?\"\n\n\"Some have,\" Moon replied, his voice soft, gaze distant. He refrained from mentioning cities reduced to ashes, forests turned to memories, rivers stilled in silence. He let the answer linger, delicate as starlight.\n\n\"When will they leave?\" Earth inquired, and as he spoke, he *felt* them\u2014their hunger, their conflicts, the scars they etched upon his surface. He shivered as a fault line cracked open along the Pacific edge.\n\n\"I don\u2019t think they can,\" Moon murmured. \"Not all of them.

Violent. Unseeing. Addicted to conquest. And if he aided their escape, they would only spread their devastation to another world\u2014another ending.\n\nBetter, then, to slip back into slumber.\n\nBetter, perhaps, for all of them to perish together.","model1":"Qwen","model2":"gpt4o_mini","domain":"writingprompts","operation":"rewrite"}

Then, at brunch time, she introduced me to sushi \u2013 something I never thought I 'd enjoy.

She grasped my chest firmly, halting my footsteps. Behind us, muffled murmurs rose. Shouts erupted.\n\n'Monster!'\n\nShe turned to me with an urgent whisper. Her words hung in mid-air, suspended like smoke: \u201cFault, listen, please. *This isn't about that man. What's happening now is because of you.\u201d\n\nA heavy shroud settled upon me.

{"human":"This paper proposes a new method for finetuning pretrained NLP models to achieve both high standard and high robust accuracy. They argue that finetuning on the more difficult and plentiful adversarial examples can lead to catastrophic forgetting, more so than standard finetuning of models. They propose an additional loss wherein the model is encouraged to get high accuracy while also retaining features from the pretrained weights. This improves the accuracy over standard finetuning and various other ways of regularizing adversarial finetuning. \n\nStrengths:\n* I like the motivation and early sections showing that adversarial finetuning shifts the model from its original weights by a much larger amount that standard finetuning.\n* There are clear gains across multiple tasks for their method.\n\nWeaknesses:\n* My main concern is that the baselines are weak. In particular, the idea of overfitting in adversarial training is well-established and past work has shown that weight decay, dropout, and these forms of standard regularization are insufficient (https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2002.11569). Instead of these, early stopping for robust accuracy is the best strategy for improving results. What I would like to see is an early stopping baseline, and what would be even better would be learning curves that show the standard and robust accuracy over time for different finetuning methods. Ideally, the paper's proposed method, if stopped at the proper time, is superior to early stopping using standard finetuning or other regularization strategies.","LLM_1":"This paper introduces a novel approach to fine-tuning pretrained NLP models with the aim of achieving high performance on both standard and adversarial inputs. The authors observe that conventional fine-tuning on adversarial examples often induces significant deviation from the pretrained weights\u2014more so than standard fine-tuning\u2014and can lead to catastrophic forgetting. To mitigate this, they propose an auxiliary loss function that encourages the model to maintain feature representations close to those of the original pretrained model while still attaining strong accuracy on adversarial data. The method demonstrates consistent improvements over standard fine-tuning and several existing regularization techniques for adversarial training.\n\n**Strengths:**  \n- The motivation is well-grounded, particularly in the initial analysis demonstrating that adversarial fine-tuning results in substantially larger weight shifts compared to standard fine-tuning.  \n- The proposed method shows clear and consistent gains across multiple downstream tasks.\n\n**Weaknesses:**  \n- A primary concern lies in the choice of baselines. The issue of overfitting in adversarial training is well-documented, and prior work (e.g., arXiv:2002.11569) has shown that traditional regularization methods such as weight decay and dropout are generally ineffective in this context. Instead, early stopping based on robust accuracy has emerged as a stronger strategy. The absence of an early stopping baseline weakens the comparison. Ideally, the authors should include learning curves that track both standard and robust accuracy throughout training for various fine-tuning approaches. Such analysis would clarify whether their method, when stopped at an optimal point, outperforms not only regularized baselines but also early-stopped standard fine-tuning.","LLM_2":"This response provides a rewritten version of your open review comment, adhering to review standards while enhancing readability and fluidness.\n\nThis work presents a compelling approach for fine-turning pre-trained NFP models to achieve robust performance across standard inputs and challenging adversarials. However, conventional adverserial fine tuning often leads to undesirable deviations from pre-trainned weights, a phenomenon known as catastrophic-forgetting. In response, authors introduce an additional loss term that ensures the preservation of pre-training feature signatures while allowing the network to adapt to adversial inputs with high accuracy.\n\nNotably, their proposed technique consistently outshines standard adversiral fine tunig and various regularization-based approaches in downstream taks.\n\nStrength:\n\n*   The underlying motivation, supported by initial findings showing that standard finetuning is less susceptible to weight deviations than adversrial finituning, is sound.\n*    The approach demonstrates clear, cross-task performance gains.\n\nWeaknes:\n\n    A key concern is the selection of baseline approaches, which may not adequately address over-fitting issues prevalent in adverse training scenarios. Recent work has highlighted that established regularization strategies, such weight-decay and drop-out, have limited efficacy in these contexts. Early stopping on the basis of robustness has instead emerged  as an effective strategy, with prior studies (arXive 200211569) highlighting its potential advantages over traditional approaches.\n\nTo strengthen the comparative analysis, it would be beneficial to include the learning-curves of various finiting approaches (including early stopped standard-adversarial fininting), tracking both the standard accuracy and the robust-accuracy throughout the training process. This would provide valuable insights into whether the proposed approach, even when optimally-stoped, excels over regularised baslines, as well as early-stoppped standard-finetuning methods. \n\nNote that this rewritten response aims to preserve your original meaning while presenting it in an engaging and concise manner, conforming with open-review comment standards.

{"human":"Obesity-linked metabolic syndrome (MetS) is associated with a dyslipidemic profile that includes hypertriglyceridemia and low plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol.

{"human":"*Quality*\n\nThe paper is easy to parse, with clear diagrams and derivations at the start. The problem context is clearly stated, as is the proposed model.\n\nThe improvements in terms of average log-likelihood are clear. The model does improve over state-of-the-art in some cases, but not all.\n\nBased on the presented findings, it is difficult to determine the quality of the learned models overall, since they are only evaluated in terms of average log likelihood. It is also difficult to determine whether the improvements are due to the model change, or some difference in how the models themselves were trained (particularly in the case of Z-Forcing, a closely related technique). I would like to see more exploration of this point, as the section titled \u201cablation studies\u201d is short and does not sufficiently address the issue of what component of the model is contributing to the observed improvements in average log-likelihood.\n\nHence, I have assigned a score of \"4\" for the following reasons: the quality of the generated models is unclear; the paper does not clearly distinguish itself from the closely-related Z-Forcing concept (published at NIPS 2017); and the reasons for the improvements shown in average log-likelihood are not explored sufficiently, that is, the ablation studies don't eliminate key parts of the model that could provide this information.\n\nMore information on this decision is given in the remainder.\n\n*Clarity*\n\nA lack of generated samples in the Experimental Results section makes it difficult to evaluate the performance of the models; log-likelihood alone can be an inadequate measure of performance without some care in how it is calculated and interpreted (refer, e.g., to Theis et al. 2016, \u201cA Note on the Evaluation of Generative Models\u201d).\n\nThere are some typos and organizational issues. For example, VAEs are reintroduced in the Related Works section, only to provide an explanation for an unrelated optimization challenge with the use of RNNs as encoders and decoders.\n\nI also find the motivations for the proposed model itself a little unclear. It seems unnatural to introduce a side-channel-cum-regularizer between a sequence moving forward in time and the same sequence moving backwards, through a variational distribution. In the introduction, improved regularization for LSTM models is cited as a primary motivation for introducing and learning two approximate distributions for latent variables between the forward and backward paths of a bi-LSTM. Is there a serious need for new regularization in such models? The need for this particular regularization choice is not particularly clear based on this explanation, nor are the improvements state-of-the-art in all cases. This weakens a possible theoretical contribution of the paper.\n\n*Originality*\n\nThe proposed modification appears to amount to a regularizer for bi-LSTMs which bears close similarity to Z-Forcing (cited in the paper). I recommend a more careful comparison between the two methods. Without such a comparison, they are a little hard to distinguish, and the originality of this paper is hard to evaluate. Both appear to employ the same core idea of regularizing an LSTM using a learned variational distributions. The differences *seem* to be in the small details, and these details appear to provide better performance in terms of average log-likelihood on all tasks compared to Z-Forcing--but, crucially, not compared to other models in all cases.","LLM_1":"The paper is generally well-structured and presents its problem context, model architecture, and initial derivations in a clear and accessible manner. Diagrams are informative, and the exposition benefits from a logical flow in the early sections.\n\nThe reported improvements in average log-likelihood are evident across several experiments. While the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in certain settings, this is not consistently observed across all tasks, which raises questions about the robustness and generalizability of the gains.\n\nA key limitation lies in the evaluation methodology: model quality is assessed exclusively through average log-likelihood, without additional metrics or qualitative analysis\u2014such as generated sample outputs\u2014that could provide deeper insight into the behavior and effectiveness of the learned models. Moreover, it remains unclear whether the observed improvements stem from architectural changes in the model or from differences in training protocols, particularly when compared to closely related methods like Z-Forcing (NIPS 2017). The ablation studies provided are insufficiently detailed; they do not systematically remove or modify core components of the model to isolate their contributions. As a result, the extent to which the proposed mechanism drives performance gains cannot be confidently determined.\n\nFor these reasons, a score of \"4\" is assigned. The primary concerns are: (1) ambiguity regarding the overall quality and generalization capability of the learned models; (2) insufficient differentiation between the proposed method and Z-Forcing, both conceptually and empirically; and (3) inadequate ablation analysis that fails to test critical design choices, thereby limiting interpretability of the results.\n\nFurther elaboration on these points follows.\n\nClarity is somewhat compromised by the absence of generated samples in the Experimental Results section. Relying solely on log-likelihood as a performance metric can be misleading, as noted by Theis et al. (2016) in \u201cA Note on the Evaluation of Generative Models,\u201d who caution against its use without careful calibration and complementary qualitative assessment. The omission of concrete examples hinders the reader\u2019s ability to assess the practical significance of the improvements.\n\nAdditionally, there are minor issues with presentation, including typographical errors and organizational inconsistencies. For instance, variational autoencoders (VAEs) are reintroduced in the Related Work section\u2014not to contextualize the current contribution, but to explain an optimization challenge associated with using RNNs as encoders and decoders\u2014an inclusion that disrupts thematic coherence.\n\nThe motivation for the proposed model also lacks clarity. The introduction of a side-channel regularization mechanism via a variational distribution connecting forward and backward passes in a bi-LSTM appears conceptually unconventional. The stated rationale\u2014improved regularization for LSTM-based models\u2014is not strongly substantiated. It is not evident that existing bi-LSTM architectures suffer from such deficiencies in regularization that necessitate this specific intervention. Furthermore, since performance improvements are not universal across all benchmarks, the theoretical novelty and practical necessity of the approach remain under-supported.\n\nRegarding originality, the proposed method closely resembles Z-Forcing, a previously published technique that similarly employs learned variational distributions to regularize LSTMs. Although subtle differences may exist in implementation details, the core idea appears substantially aligned. A more rigorous comparative analysis\u2014both theoretical and empirical\u2014is necessary to delineate the distinctions clearly. Without such a comparison, the degree of novelty is difficult to assess. While the current results suggest superior performance relative to Z-Forcing in terms of average log-likelihood across all tasks, this advantage does not extend uniformly over all competing models. Consequently, the claim to originality rests on fine-grained distinctions that require stronger justification.","LLM_2":"The submitted paper demonstrates a well-defined structure, presenting its key components, such as problem formulation, architectural details of its proposed models, initial findings, in an easily understandable and clear manner, accompanied by informative diagrams that enhance comprehension. However, an even more logical and coherent flow of ideas in later sections would further improve the paper's overall clarity.\n\nSignificant improvements reported in mean log likelihood across various experiments are discernible. Despite the fact that the suggested model excels over state of art approaches under specific conditions, its consistent performance across multiple tasks raises doubts about its robust and generalized capabilities.\n\nOne major limitation of this work is its evaluation strategy: the assessment of model performance is limited to mean likelihood, with no additional measurements or in-depth qualitative analyses, like the analysis of sample generation, that could offer deeper insights into model behavior. Additionally, when comparing to related techniques like \"Z- Forcing\" (The 34th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems,  1  NIPS2018), it is unclear if the reported gains are due to architectural modifications or training protocol variations. Inadequate ablations studies are provided; the systematic removal or modification of key model components to determine their individual contributions is insufficient. Therefore, determining the exact role of proposed mechanisms in driving performance enhancements remains uncertain.\n\nIn light of these issues, I would assign a rating of '4.' The key concerns include: \n\n(1). Lack of clarity regarding model overall performance capabilities and robust generalizations.\n(2). Inability to differentiate between proposed and \" Z - Forcings\" both theoretically and experimentally.\n3). Failure to conduct ablication studies that assess critical desing choices and therefore impact the interpretation of results\n\nBelow, further elaborations on this points follow.\n\nReadability is compromised due the lack of samples generated in Experimental results. Relaying solely mean- likelihood as performance metrics can lead to misleading results, especially as cautioned by ( The 30th Annual Conference of Computational Learning Theory,    The note on Evaluation generative models ,2015) who suggest its misuse without proper calibration alongside qualitative assessments. Omitting concrete instances makes it difficult for readers to evaluate the significance and applicability.\n\nMoreover, minor formatting issues and organisational inconsistencies exist, for example, \" Variational Autoencodes\" are mentioned in related work to discuss optimisation challenges of using \"RNN\"s as encoder and decoder, rather than contextualizing the present contribution which disrupt the thematic cohesion.\n\nFurthermore, motivation behind the developed model is vague. Introducing a novel side channel regularization via variate distribution between forward pass and backwards pass in Bi-LSTMS appears unconventional concept. Stated rationale of improved regularization in LSTM based models is weakly supported. Lack clarity in existing Bi- Lstms architectural issues necessitating this intervention remains unsubstantiated.\n\nAs regards originalities, proposed methods closely resemble \"z-forcing\", published earlier which employ variated distribution to regulize \"LSTM\"s.  Although minor differences might exist on implementation, core concept seems substantially similar. More rigorous comparison of both theoretical empirical analysis is needed to clearly distinguish these two approaches. Current results demonstrate superior performace in relation to \" z-forcign\" in all task, however this advanatage does extend uniformally over other models competing. Thus original claim rest on finer distinctions which require more stringent justification.\n\nNote: I have kept the structure and content of your review intact, only making minor adjustments to ensure clarity and consistency in presentation. I also made some minor changes to improve readability and maintain the formal tone of an academic comment. \n\nRating:'4'","model1":"Qwen","model2":"llama","domain":"openreview","operation":"polish"}

{"human":"In response to tissue damage or inflammation, adenosine-5'-triphosphate (ATP) is released into the extracellular compartment and has been demonstrated to augment inflammation via purinergic P2 receptors (P2Rs). Recently, ATP has been shown to be increased in the airways of COPD patients. In the present study, we examined the possible involvement of extracellular ATP in airway mucus hypersecretion during viral-induced COPD exacerbations.The involvement of extracellular ATP in the release of a major airway mucin, MUC5AC, and its signal pathway was examined after stimulation with polyinosine-polycytidylic acid [poly(I:C)], a synthetic analog of dsRNA to mimic viral infection, and rhinovirus (RV) infection in NCI-H292 cells and differentiated airway epithelial cells from COPD patients.Treatment with poly(I:C) significantly increased the amount of extracellular ATP and induced MUC5AC release in NCI-H292 cells. Pre-treatment with a pannexin channel inhibitor, carbenoxolone (CBX), reduced the amount of extracellular ATP and suppressed MUC5AC release from poly(I:C)-treated cells. Pre-treatment with the P2R antagonist suramin significantly reduced the expression and release of MUC5AC. The inhibitory effects of CBX and suramin on the release of ATP and\/or MUC5AC were replicated with RV infection. Pre-treatment with suramin also significantly reduced the expression and amount of extracellular EGFR ligands and the phosphorylation of EGFR and ERK in poly(I:C)-treated cells. In addition, pre-treatment with a P2Y2 receptor siRNA significantly suppressed the poly(I:C)-potentiated EGFR ligands and MUC5AC release. After poly(I:C) stimulation, the expression of MUC5AC in the differentiated cells from COPD patients was significantly higher than those from healthy subjects and the values of MUC5AC expression were inversely related with forced expiratory volume in 1\u00a0s (FEV1) % predicted. The inhibitory effects of CBX and suramin on poly(I:C)-potentiated MUC5AC expression were confirmed in differentiated airway epithelium from COPD patients.","LLM_1":"Extracellular adenosine-5'-triphosphate (ATP), released in response to tissue injury or inflammatory stimuli, has been implicated in the amplification of inflammation through activation of purinergic P2 receptors (P2Rs). Elevated levels of ATP have been observed in the airways of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), suggesting a potential role in disease pathogenesis. This study investigates the contribution of extracellular ATP to airway mucus hypersecretion during viral-induced exacerbations of COPD. Using polyinosine-polycytidylic acid [poly(I:C)], a synthetic double-stranded RNA analog, and rhinovirus (RV) infection as models of viral stimulation, the regulation of MUC5AC mucin expression and its underlying signaling mechanisms were examined in NCI-H292 cells and differentiated primary airway epithelial cells derived from COPD patients. Stimulation with poly(I:C) led to a significant increase in extracellular ATP release and subsequent MUC5AC secretion. Pharmacological inhibition of pannexin channels with carbenoxolone (CBX) attenuated both ATP release and MUC5AC production. Similarly, pretreatment with the broad-spectrum P2R antagonist suramin markedly reduced MUC5AC expression and secretion. These inhibitory effects were consistently observed under RV infection conditions. Suramin also suppressed the induction of extracellular epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) ligands, as well as the phosphorylation of EGFR and ERK in poly(I:C)-stimulated cells. Moreover, silencing of the P2Y\u2082 receptor using specific siRNA significantly diminished poly(I:C)-induced EGFR ligand release and MUC5AC expression. In differentiated airway epithelial cells from COPD patients, poly(I:C) elicited a significantly greater MUC5AC response compared to cells from healthy individuals, with MUC5AC levels inversely correlating with forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV\u2081)% predicted. The suppressive effects of CBX and suramin on MUC5AC upregulation were further validated in these patient-derived epithelial cultures. These findings indicate that extracellular ATP contributes to viral-induced MUC5AC hypersecretion in COPD via P2R-dependent activation of the EGFR-ERK signaling pathway, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target in COPD exacerbations.","LLM_2":"**Abstract**\n\nExtracellular adenosine-5'-triphosphate (ATP), released in response to tissue damage or inflammatory signals, plays a significant role in enhancing inflammation through the activation of purinergic P2 receptors (P2Rs).

{"human":"Acute lung injury often complicates severe sepsis. In gram-negative sepsis, bacterial endotoxin activates both coagulation and inflammation. Enhanced lung vascular pressures and permeability, increased extravascular lung water content and deteriorated gas exchange characterize ovine endotoxin-induced lung injury, a frequently used model of acute lung injury. Recombinant human activated protein C (rhAPC), with its anticoagulant, anti-inflammatory, fibrinolytic and antiapoptotic effects, reportedly reduces the respirator-dependent days and the mortality of patients with severe sepsis. We speculate whether rhAPC antagonizes endotoxin-induced lung injury in sheep.Two groups of sheep were exposed to Escherichia coli endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide) 15 ng\/kg\/minute intravenously from 0 to 24 hours; one group received only lipopolysaccharide throughout (n = 8), and the other group received lipopolysaccharide in combination with rhAPC 24 microg\/kg\/hour from 4 to 24 hours (n = 9). In addition, one group received rhAPC as above as the only intervention (n = 4), and four sham-operated sheep were used for determination of the alpha and epsilon isoforms of protein kinase C in pulmonary tissue. Data were assessed by one-way analysis of variance for repeated measurements. Biochemical data were analyzed using Student's t test, or using the Mann-Whitney U test when appropriate.Infusion of endotoxin caused lung injury, manifested by increments in pulmonary artery pressure, in pulmonary micro-occlusion pressure, in pulmonary vascular downstream resistance, in pulmonary vascular permeability index, in extravascular lung water index and in deterioration of oxygenation that were all attenuated by infusion of rhAPC. Endotoxemia led to changes in inflammation and coagulation, including pulmonary neutrophil accumulation paralleled by increased TNFalpha and decreased protein C and fibrinogen in animal plasma, which all improved following infusion of rhAPC. Moreover, rhAPC prevented the translocation of protein kinase C alpha and epsilon isoforms from the cytosolic fraction of lung tissue extracts.","LLM_1":"Acute lung injury is a common complication of severe sepsis, particularly in the context of gram-negative infection, where endotoxin-mediated activation of coagulation and inflammatory pathways contributes to pulmonary dysfunction. In an ovine model of endotoxin-induced acute lung injury, characterized by elevated lung vascular pressures, increased vascular permeability, accumulation of extravascular lung water, and impaired gas exchange, the potential protective effects of recombinant human activated protein C (rhAPC) were investigated. rhAPC, known for its anticoagulant, anti-inflammatory, fibrinolytic, and antiapoptotic properties, has been shown to reduce mortality and duration of mechanical ventilation in patients with severe sepsis. This study examined whether rhAPC attenuates endotoxin-induced lung injury in sheep. Two groups received continuous intravenous infusion of *Escherichia coli* lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 15 ng\/kg\/min) from 0 to 24 hours: one group (n = 8) received LPS alone, while the other (n = 9) additionally received rhAPC (24 \u03bcg\/kg\/h) from 4 to 24 hours. A third group received rhAPC without LPS (n = 4), and a sham-operated control group (n = 4) was included for analysis of pulmonary protein kinase C (PKC) alpha and epsilon isoforms. Hemodynamic, respiratory, and biochemical parameters were evaluated using repeated-measures one-way ANOVA; biochemical data were analyzed using Student\u2019s t-test or Mann-Whitney U test as appropriate. LPS infusion induced significant lung injury, evidenced by increased pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary micro-occlusion pressure, downstream pulmonary vascular resistance, pulmonary vascular permeability index, extravascular lung water index, and impaired oxygenation\u2014all of which were significantly attenuated by rhAPC administration. Endotoxemia also resulted in systemic and pulmonary inflammation and coagulopathy, including neutrophil sequestration in the lungs, elevated plasma TNF\u03b1 levels, and reduced levels of protein C and fibrinogen\u2014parameters that showed marked improvement with rhAPC. Furthermore, rhAPC prevented the translocation of PKC alpha and epsilon isoforms from the cytosolic to membrane fractions in lung tissue, suggesting modulation of intracellular signaling pathways involved in inflammation and endothelial dysfunction. These findings indicate that rhAPC mitigates endotoxin-induced lung injury in sheep through multifactorial mechanisms involving stabilization of pulmonary hemodynamics, preservation of endothelial integrity, attenuation of inflammatory responses, and inhibition of procoagulant activity.","LLM_2":"**Abstract**\n\nAcute lung injury frequently arises as a complication of severe sepsis, particularly in cases of gram-negative infections, where the endotoxin triggers activation of coagulation and inflammatory pathways, leading to pulmonary dysfunction. This study utilized an ovine model of endotoxin-induced acute lung injury, characterized by increased lung vascular pressures, heightened vascular permeability, accumulation of extravascular lung water, and compromised gas exchange, to investigate the potential protective effects of recombinant human activated protein C (rhAPC). Known for its properties as an anticoagulant, anti-inflammatory, fibrinolytic, and antiapoptotic agent, rhAPC has previously demonstrated a capacity to reduce mortality and the duration of mechanical ventilation in severe sepsis patients. The present research aimed to determine whether rhAPC could alleviate endotoxin-induced lung injury in sheep. Two experimental groups were subjected to a continuous intravenous infusion of *Escherichia coli* lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 15 ng\/kg\/min) for 24 hours: one group (n = 8) received LPS alone, while the other (n = 9) was administered rhAPC (24 \u03bcg\/kg\/h) from 4 to 24 hours. A third group received rhAPC without LPS (n = 4), and a sham-operated control group (n = 4) was included to analyze pulmonary protein kinase C (PKC) alpha and epsilon isoforms. The evaluation of hemodynamic, respiratory, and biochemical parameters was performed using repeated-measures one-way ANOVA, while biochemical data were analyzed appropriately using Student\u2019s t-test or Mann-Whitney U test. LPS infusion resulted in significant lung injury, as indicated by increased pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary micro-occlusion pressure, downstream pulmonary vascular resistance, pulmonary vascular permeability index, extravascular lung water index, and impaired oxygenation\u2014all of which were significantly improved by rhAPC treatment. Endotoxemia also led to systemic and pulmonary inflammation, as well as coagulopathy, exemplified by neutrophil sequestration in the lungs, elevated plasma TNF\u03b1 levels, and decreased protein C and fibrinogen levels; all these parameters exhibited notable enhancement following rhAPC administration. Moreover, rhAPC effectively prevented the translocation of PKC alpha and epsilon isoforms from the cytosolic to membrane fractions in lung tissue, indicating a modulation of intracellular signaling pathways related to inflammation and endothelial dysfunction. These results suggest that rhAPC alleviates endotoxin-induced lung injury in sheep through a multifaceted approach that includes stabilization of pulmonary hemodynamics, preservation of endothelial integrity, reduction of inflammatory responses, and inhibition of procoagulant activity.","model1":"Qwen","model2":"gpt4o_mini","domain":"pubmedqa","operation":"rewrite"}

{"human":"A layer wise optimization for CNNs with ReLU activations and max-pooling is proposed and shown to correspond to a series of latent structured SVM problems. Using CCCP style optimization a monotonic decrease of the overall objective function can be guaranteed.\n\nSummary:\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nI think the discussed insights are very interesting but not presented convincingly. Firstly, claims are emphasized which are often violated in practice (e.g., no convergence guarantees due to mini-batches), statements could be validated more convincingly (e.g., is monotone convergence a curse or a blessing), the experimental evaluation should be extended. In summary, I think the paper requires some more attention to form a compelling story.\n\nQuality: I think some of the techniques could be described more carefully to better convey the intuition. At times apples are compared to oranges, e.g., back propagation is contrasted with CCCP.\nClarity: Some of the derivations and intuitions could be explained in more detail.\nOriginality: The suggested idea is reasonable albeit heuristics are required.\nSignificance: Since the experimental setup is somewhat limited according to my opinion, significance is hard to judge at this point in time.\n\nDetails:\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n1. I think the provided guarantees for the optimization procedure are certainly convenient theoretically but their practical relevance still needs to be demonstrated more convincingly, e.g., mini-batch optimization alleviates any form of monotonic decrease. Hence the emphasize in the paper is somewhat misguided according to my opinion and given he current experimental evaluation.\n\n2. In spirit similar is work by B. Amos and J. Kolter, Input-Convex Deep Networks (https:\/\/openreview.net\/pdf?id=ROVmA279BsvnM0J1IpNn) ICLR Workshop Track 2016; which should probably be mentioned.\n\n3. I think the comparison between backprop and the discussed CCCP approach is not really appropriate. Note that backprop is a mechanism to compute gradients and is not at all related to any optimization technique\/algorithm. This means that backprop combined with Armijo line-search would for example result in convergence guarantees. Hence a statement like `one of the main advantages of our approach compared to back propagation and its variants, which fail to provide similar guarantees on the value of the objective function from one iteration to the next\u2019 is according to my opinion superficial.\n\n4. More justification regarding the argument that search for the step-size is a disadvantage seems necessary. There is evidence that noise introduced by mini-batches and inaccurate\/no line search is actually beneficial. In contrast the proposed CCCP procedure may converge pre-maturely to a local optimum close to the initialization. Since mini-batches are used no guarantees are available in any case. Hence I think additional evidence for the fact that such convergence guarantees don\u2019t result in premature stopping seems necessary.\n\n5. The observation 1 required to convert the layer wise procedure into an SVM seems rather ad-hoc. Note that you can easily construct examples where Eq. (9) and Eq. (7) differ significantly.\n\n6. I personally think the experimental evaluation is conducted on examples that are too small and some results are obvious. E.g., LW-SVM always improves over the solution of the SGD algorithm. If the authors were to use backtracking line search they could also improve upon LW-SVM.","LLM_1":"A layer-wise optimization framework for CNNs with ReLU activations and max-pooling is proposed, which is shown to correspond to a sequence of latent structured SVM problems.

{"human":"Involving caregivers in trauma-focused treatments for youth has been shown to result in better outcomes, but it is not clear which in-session caregiver behaviors enhance or inhibit this effect. The current study examined the associations between caregiver behaviors during Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT) and youth cognitive processes and symptoms.Participants were a racially diverse sample of Medicaid-eligible youth (ages 7-17) and their nonoffending caregivers (N = 71 pairs) who received TF-CBT through an effectiveness study in a community setting. Caregiver and youth processes were coded from audio-recorded sessions, and outcomes were measured using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and UCLA PTSD Reaction Index for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders-Fourth Edition (DSM-IV; UPID) at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months postintake.Piecewise linear growth curve modeling revealed that during the trauma narrative phase of TF-CBT, caregivers' cognitive-emotional processing of their own and their child's trauma-related reactions predicted decreases in youth internalizing and externalizing symptoms over treatment. Caregiver support predicted lower internalizing symptoms over follow-up. In contrast, caregiver avoidance and blame of the child predicted worsening of youth internalizing and externalizing symptoms over follow-up. Caregiver avoidance early in treatment also predicted worsening of externalizing symptoms over follow-up. During the narrative phase, caregiver blame and avoidance were correlated with more child overgeneralization of trauma beliefs, and blame was also associated with less child accommodation of balanced beliefs.","LLM_1":"Involving caregivers in trauma-focused interventions for youth has been associated with improved treatment outcomes; however, the specific in-session caregiver behaviors that contribute to these effects remain unclear. This study investigated the relationship between caregiver behaviors during Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT) and youth cognitive processes and symptom trajectories. The sample consisted of a racially diverse, Medicaid-eligible cohort of youth aged 7\u201317 and their nonoffending caregivers (N = 71 dyads) participating in a community-based effectiveness trial of TF-CBT. Audio recordings of therapy sessions were coded to assess caregiver and youth processes, while outcomes were evaluated using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and the UCLA PTSD Reaction Index for DSM-IV (UPID) at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months post-intake. Piecewise linear growth curve analyses indicated that, during the trauma narrative phase, caregivers\u2019 engagement in cognitive-emotional processing of both their own and their child\u2019s trauma-related reactions was associated with greater reductions in youth internalizing and externalizing symptoms throughout treatment. Caregiver support was linked to lower levels of internalizing symptoms during follow-up. Conversely, caregiver avoidance and attribution of blame toward the child were associated with increases in both internalizing and externalizing symptoms over time, with early treatment avoidance specifically predicting worsening externalizing symptoms. Additionally, during the narrative phase, caregiver blame and avoidance were positively correlated with children\u2019s overgeneralization of trauma-related beliefs, while blame was negatively associated with children\u2019s adoption of balanced belief systems.","LLM_2":"This study elucidates the salient caregiver behaviours that facilitate improved outcomes in Traumatic-Focus Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for children. Specifically, we investigated how caregiver actions during TF- CBT sessions intersect with youth cognition and symptoms trajectories in an ethnically diverse cohort (n =71 caregiver-youth dyad) undergoing a real-world effectiveness evaluation. Through audio-recorded session coding and longitudinal assessment using established measures (Child Behaviour Checklist and UCLA-PTSD Reaction Indices), we found that caregivers' active engagement with cognitive and emotional processing, concerning both themselves and children, in response to traumatic experiences, is associated significantly with reduced internalising and behaviour problems in children across the treatment period. Notably, supportive caregiver interactions were linked with diminished internalisation symptoms at follow-ups. In contrast, avoidance of traumatic narratives and caregiver attributions of fault towards children correlated positively with increased internalization and behavioral problems over the course of treatment, particularly early avoidance predicting exacerbation of externalising symptoms.\n\nMoreover, our findings suggest that caregiver blaming and avoiding during narrative phases are positively associated  with the children's over-generalization  of maladaptive beliefs related to trauma, whereas blaming is negatively correlated  to balanced cognition systems adoption by children during this phase. These results underscore the importance of caregiver support and active processing in TF C BT and inform the development of targeted interventions to mitigate the impact of adverse caregiver responses.","model1":"Qwen","model2":"llama","domain":"pubmedqa","operation":"rewrite"}

It was reported that inflammatory changes in the periadventitial fat may have a direct role in the pathogenesis of vascular diseases accelerated by obesity. We investigated the effect of endovascular injury on the phenotype of perivascular fat.Endovascular injury significantly upregulated proinflammatory adipocytokines and downregulated adiponectin within periadventitial fat tissue in models of mouse femoral artery wire injury and rat iliac artery balloon injury. Genetic disruption of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha attenuated upregulation of proinflammatory adipocytokine expression, with reduced neointimal hyperplasia after vascular injury. Local delivery of TNF-alpha to the periadventitial area enhanced inflammatory adipocytokine expression, which was associated with augmented neointimal hyperplasia in TNF-alpha-deficient mice.

This investigation explored the effects of endovascular injury on the phenotypic transformation of perivascular adipose tissue. Utilizing experimental models of vascular injury\u2014specifically, murine femoral artery wire injury and rat iliac artery balloon injury\u2014we observed a marked increase in proinflammatory adipocytokines alongside a reduction in adiponectin expression within periadventitial fat. Genetic deletion of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) mitigated the upregulation of proinflammatory adipocytokines and decreased neointimal hyperplasia post-injury. In contrast, localized administration of TNF-\u03b1 to the periadventitial area amplified inflammatory adipocytokine expression and aggravated neointimal formation in TNF-\u03b1-deficient mice. Additionally, conditioned medium from co-cultures of 3T3-L1 adipocytes and RAW264 macrophages stimulated vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation, an effect that was nullified by treatment with an anti-TNF-\u03b1 neutralizing antibody in the co-culture system.
