To do this, simply open HandBrake on your Mac, import the MOV file, select the desired output format (MP4, of course), and let the software do its magic. Make sure to adjust the settings according to your phone's requirements, like resolution and bitrate. Once the conversion is complete, transfer the new MPV file to phone via USB or wirelessly, depending on what's more convenient for your setup.
