{"human":"Apart from the good results presented in the paper, I have some questions about the paper as below:\n1) P2 L67, the authors mentioned the good performance on the early action recognition task, but I have not found early action related experiment presented in the paper.\n2) P4 L147, the authors clarify that they aim to quantify the correlation between different temporal states. But for **2nd line in eq.3**, how the Hadamard Product operation between two spatial states is able to quantify the correlation between matrices? \n3) Do SUM and MUL in Figure 1 represent summation and multiplication?

Such analysis would strengthen the claim that the proposed attention module meaningfully improves performance.\n\n3) The description of the feature aggregation strategy in Section 3.3 (P5) could benefit from greater clarity. Specifically, it is unclear how features from different modalities\u2014visual, audio, and motion\u2014are aligned before fusion.

Real-world video data often exhibit significant class imbalance, and high overall accuracy can mask poor generalization on rare classes. Including metrics such as per-class accuracy, F1-score across rare vs. frequent categories, or results on balanced subsets would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the model\u2019s robustness.\n\n5) The paper does not discuss computational efficiency or inference speed, which are critical factors for deployment in real-time applications such as surveillance or human-computer interaction. Reporting latency measurements, FLOPs, or parameter counts in comparison to baseline methods would help contextualize the practicality of the proposed approach, especially given the use of multi-stream architectures that may increase resource demands.\n\n6) Some figures lack sufficient annotation to fully interpret the findings. For instance, Figure 3 presents attention weights over time but does not indicate which action category the visualization corresponds to, nor does it clarify whether the sample is correctly classified. Adding labels, ground-truth information, and error cases would enhance the interpretability of qualitative results and support the narrative around model behavior.\n\n7) The training protocol mentions data augmentation techniques but omits specific details on hyperparameter selection, such as learning rate schedules, optimizer configurations, or batch size. Moreover, there is no indication of the number of runs performed to ensure result stability. Including these details, possibly in an appendix or supplementary material, would improve experimental rigor and facilitate replication efforts.\n\n8) While the method is evaluated on established datasets like Something-Something V2 and EPIC-Kitchens, the absence of testing on domain-shifted or out-of-distribution data limits claims about generalization. A brief experiment on a slightly perturbed version of the test set\u2014e.g., with added noise, frame dropping, or style transfer\u2014could offer insights into model resilience under distributional shifts.\n\n9) The related work section provides a solid overview of action recognition and multimodal learning but could better position the novelty of the current contribution. In particular, the distinctions between the proposed temporal attention and prior works on time-aware modeling (e.g., TSM, TimeSformer) should be more sharply articulated.

At times, it refers to predicting actions with partial input, while in other instances, it seems conflated with fast inference. The authors should clearly define this term early in the paper and maintain consistent usage to avoid confusion.\n\n11) The model leverages optical flow as one of its input modalities, which requires expensive pre-processing and increases training complexity. However, no justification is provided for retaining hand-crafted flow features instead of using learned motion representations through deformable convolutions or self-supervised motion encoders. Addressing this design decision would help assess the necessity of computationally intensive preprocessing steps.\n\n12) Lastly, the ethical implications of deploying such models in sensitive environments are not discussed. Given the potential for misuse in surveillance or automated behavioral monitoring, a brief reflection on privacy considerations, bias mitigation, and intended use cases would align the work with responsible AI research standards.\n\nIn summary, the paper presents a promising framework for multimodal action recognition with compelling empirical results.

{"human":"Summary:\n\nMain topic of the paper is to study various infinite width limits. The paper notices different scaling used in NTK limit and MF limit and proposes a general framework for studying the limit behavior depending on the scaling. This allows the authors to define more general dynamically stable models in the infinite width limit. \n\nStated contribution by authors are:\n\n- Framework for reasoning about scaling that leads to \u2018dynamically stable\u2019 model evolution in the infinite width limit. \n- Categorization of 13 distinct dynamically stable models in the infinite width limit.\n- Characterization of \u201csym-default\u201d model, which along with NTK and MF limit which shows properties most of finite-width network evolution. \n- Model modification \u201cInitialization-corrected mean-field limit\u201d(IC-MF) that satisfy all identified property of finite-width network evolution\n- Demonstration of IC-MF limit approximating finite-width network the best among all other possible models. \n \nReason for score:\n\nThe paper proposes an interesting theoretical framework to capture various infinite width limits. While settings are limited to make theory tractable, there is some empirical validation as well as capacity to broaden the study to different infinite width limits. I believe there are interesting novelties to be shared among ICLR participants who are interested in deep learning theory. \n\nPros:\nGeneral framework encapsulates widely studied infinite width limits and generalizes them which would be useful for theoretical study of large neural networks.\n\nThe paper makes predictions on scaling limits and finds a limit that could agree with finite networks better (IC-MF). For a variety of experiments the fact that this class matches with a reference finite width network is demonstrated well. \n\nWhile the proposed analysis is limited to a single hidden layer case, the authors have described thoughtful possibilities how the framework could potentially generalize to deeper networks. \nAuthors shared code to reproduce their experiments in the paper which is useful for reproduction and clearly understand different proposed scalings.\n\nCons:\n\nBeing single hidden layer analysis is a drawback (while discussion on extension is appreciated and stated in the \u201cpros\u201d). Often multi-layer infinite width is more interesting since the number of hidden layer weights scales quadratically while only the input and output layer weight count scales linearly with width. This can induce different training dynamics and scaling, so limitation to single hidden layer analysis is a drawback. \n\nTo simplify proof non-linearity of the choice is \u201cleaky softplus\u201d which is not widely used in practice. Having general comments on extension or limitation to well-known activations is advised. \n\nAssumption in p3 stating \u201cgradients for a and W are estimated using independent data samples\u201d may be too strong and not realistic. I cannot find no validation that the assumption is a reasonable one to make beyond making the theory simple. This may lead to inconsistencies raised in the \u201cQuestions\u201d below. \n\nExperiments demonstrating similar effect for more realistic setting (e.g. full CIFAR-10 classification task achieving reasonable performance) would have been better to convince the validity or generalizability of the theory. While one can see that IC-MF and reference agrees well for the training curve, for test-set since every curve essentially behaves the same it is hard to determine which limit is superior or not. \n\nQuestions:\nIn [Liu et al., 2020], they show non-constancy of NTK for non-linear output including the soft-max layer in the outputs. I believe this fact may be in conflict with this paper\u2019s analysis on binary cross-entropy loss and still having constant NTK. I do suspect it may be due to assumptions on independent gradients for `a` and `W` in page 3. Do you think in a realistic training setting with softmax-cross entropy, you can generalize the analysis and reconcile the fact that NTK is non-constant?\n\nIn general, does the generalization of \u201cdynamical stability\u201d to admit infinite logits valid for multi-class cases? In multi-class simple \u201csign\u201d can\u2019t be used for classification and I wonder if authors have ideas on generalization to multi-class settings. \n\nIn eq (26), why is Gaussian distribution over logit a good way to measure KL divergence? I understand at initialization prior is distributed over Gaussian, however after training with softmax I expect the logit distribution is no-longer Gaussian. \n\nNits and additional feedback:\n\nNit: use \\citep in places where appropriate.\n\nDivision (\/) for denoting \u201cor\u201d is often confusing and would suggest other notation. Especially in the Figures and Condition 2 when sometimes it means \u201cor\u201d and sometimes it means division.\n\np4: \u2018grows width\u2019 -> \u2018grows with\u2019\n\n[Sohl-Dickstein et al., 2020] show different scaling of weight and bias scaling extending standard parameterization to work well with NTK limit. While this paper mostly works with the NTK parameterization, it would be interesting to discuss how the improved parameterization in [Sohl-Dickstein et al., 2020] can be utilized. I suspect this is quite related to (9) \/ (10) where definition of NTK deviates from [Jacot et al., 2018]. \n\nIn Section 3: When comparing performance on finite networks and NTK, it can be subtle depending on how one trains finite networks and there\u2019s architecture dependence [Lee et al., 2020] \nIn Section 4: suggest citing [Chizat et al., 2019] for \u2018lazy training\u2019\n\nChizat et al., On Lazy Training in Differentiable Programming, NeurIPS 2019\nLee et al., Finite Versus Infinite Neural Networks: an Empirical Study, arXiv: 2007.15801\nLiu et al., On the linearity of large non-linear models: when and why the tangent kernel is constant, arXiv:2010.01092\nSohl-Dickstein et al., On the infinite width limit of neural networks with a standard parameterization, arXiv:2001.07301\n\n----\n[post rebuttal]\nI thank the authors for their revision and clarifying many of my questions and adding results based on that. I have read other reviewers concern and while I agree some room for improvement on clarity, I still think the paper brings in value. Unless there's technical flaws spotted by other reviewers that has not been resolved, I'm still leaning towards accepting (increased score from 6 to 7). ","LLM_1":"- The proposed framework offers a principled way to analyze how different parameter scalings influence the dynamics of neural networks in the infinite width limit. This perspective enables a more systematic comparison across regimes that were previously treated in isolation, such as NTK and mean-field, thereby enriching the theoretical landscape.\n\n- One particularly compelling aspect is the identification of \"dynamically stable\" models\u2014those whose evolution remains non-trivial and well-defined as width increases. The paper\u2019s criterion for dynamic stability provides a useful filter for distinguishing meaningful scaling limits from degenerate ones, which is likely to inform future theoretical work in this domain.\n\n- The categorization into 13 distinct stable models is both surprising and insightful. It reveals a richer structure in the space of possible infinite-width limits than commonly assumed, suggesting that current classifications may be overly restrictive. This taxonomy could serve as a foundation for further exploration of alternative training regimes and architectures.\n\n- The introduction of the \u201csym-default\u201d model is an important empirical contribution. Its close alignment with finite-width network behavior\u2014even without explicit tuning\u2014suggests it may represent a natural baseline for comparison in theoretical studies. This could help bridge the gap between idealized asymptotic analyses and practical deep learning settings.\n\n- The IC-MF (Initialization-corrected mean-field) limit stands out as a practically motivated refinement. By correcting for initialization-induced biases, it achieves better correspondence with finite-width dynamics. This correction is simple in concept but appears to have significant implications for fidelity in modeling real network evolution.\n\n- Empirical validation, while limited in scope, effectively supports the theoretical claims. The experiments on small-scale networks demonstrate measurable differences among scaling regimes and confirm that IC-MF tracks finite-width training more closely than other limits. These results lend credibility to the framework's predictive power.\n\n- The paper makes testable predictions about optimal scalings for different layers and parameters, which opens up new avenues for experimental design. Future work could leverage these insights to develop adaptive scaling strategies during initialization or training.\n\n- A notable strength is the clarity with which the authors disentangle the role of scaling from architectural choices. This separation allows for cleaner analysis and generalization beyond specific network types, enhancing the framework\u2019s applicability.\n\n- While the focus remains on fully connected networks, the methodology appears extensible to other architectures. With appropriate modifications, similar analysis could be applied to convolutional or attention-based models, potentially uncovering new scaling laws in those contexts.\n\n- The discussion around symmetry in initialization and its impact on limiting dynamics adds nuance to existing assumptions. Recognizing that symmetric initialization can lead to unintended cancellations or degeneracies improves our understanding of why certain limits behave pathologically.\n\n- Mathematical derivations are presented with sufficient rigor and intuition. The use of formalism is balanced\u2014neither overly dense nor lacking in precision\u2014making the core ideas accessible to readers with a solid background in machine learning theory.\n\n- Notation is consistent and well-defined throughout, facilitating comprehension of complex relationships between scaling exponents and their dynamical consequences. The inclusion of detailed appendices further strengthens reproducibility and transparency.\n\n- One limitation lies in the assumption of continuous-time gradient flow, which simplifies analysis but may obscure discrete-update effects present in practical optimization. Extending the framework to discrete time could reveal additional constraints or corrections relevant to real-world training.\n\n- The dependence on smooth activation functions (e.g., sigmoidal or softplus) restricts immediate applicability to ReLU-like networks, where non-differentiability at zero introduces technical challenges. Addressing piecewise-linear activations would broaden the framework\u2019s relevance.\n\n- Although the paper identifies multiple stable models, the practical significance of some of the 13 categories remains unclear. Further investigation into which of these emerge naturally in standard training setups\u2014or whether they require fine-tuned hyperparameters\u2014would strengthen the empirical grounding.\n\n- There is potential for connections to related areas such as lottery ticket hypothesis or pruning dynamics, where initialization and scaling play crucial roles. Exploring these links could enhance interdisciplinary impact.\n\n- The paper does not extensively explore the effect of data distribution or label structure on the observed limits. Since infinite-width behavior can depend strongly on input geometry, future extensions might incorporate data-dependent analysis.\n\n- Despite being theoretically focused, the paper maintains a strong connection to observable phenomena. This balance ensures that abstract concepts remain anchored in tangible network behaviors, increasing their utility for practitioners and theorists alike.\n\n- The concept of dynamic stability could be formalized further through convergence rates or perturbation analysis. Quantifying how robust each limit is to small deviations in width or initialization might yield additional criteria for selecting viable scaling schemes.\n\n- Presentation quality is high: figures are informative, equations are well-labeled, and logical flow guides the reader from motivation to results. The narrative builds progressively, making complex ideas feel approachable.\n\n- Supplementary material includes thorough derivations and additional experiments, demonstrating care in documentation. This enhances trust in the findings and lowers the barrier for follow-up research.\n\n- The work invites reconsideration of standard practices in initialization and normalization. If widely adopted, the insights here could influence how we design and scale large models, especially in regimes approaching infinite width.\n\n- Potential applications include improved surrogate models for architecture search, better initialization protocols, and enhanced interpretability of training trajectories in overparameterized systems.\n\n- Overall, the paper advances the theoretical understanding of neural network limits in a structured and generalizable way. Its contributions are foundational rather than immediately applied, but they lay the groundwork for deeper investigations into the mechanics of deep learning.","LLM_2":"**\n\nThe paper presents a principled framework for analyzing how parameter scalings affect neural network dynamics in the infinite-width limit, enabling a systematic comparison of previously isolated regimes such as NTK and mean-field.

Further study into which regimes naturally arise in standard settings\u2014versus those requiring fine-tuned hyperparameters\u2014would strengthen empirical grounding. Likewise, connections to related areas such as lottery ticket hypothesis or pruning dynamics remain underexplored, despite shared sensitivities to initialization and scaling.\n\nThe influence of data distribution and label structure on limiting behavior is not deeply examined, despite known dependencies in infinite-width analyses. Future work incorporating data-dependent dynamics could enhance the framework\u2019s scope.\n\nFurther formalization of dynamic stability\u2014e.g., via convergence rates or perturbation analysis\u2014could provide quantitative robustness measures and refine criteria for viable scaling schemes. Ultimately, the insights may inform best practices in initialization, normalization, and model scaling, particularly as systems approach large-width limits.\n\nIn summary, this work advances the theoretical foundations of neural network scaling in a structured, generalizable manner. While primarily conceptual, its contributions are substantial: they reframe existing paradigms, offer actionable hypotheses, and lay groundwork for deeper exploration into the mechanics of deep learning. Potential applications include improved surrogate models for architecture search, better initialization protocols, and enhanced interpretability of training dynamics in overparameterized systems.","op1":"create","op2":"refine","domain":"openreview","model":"Qwen"}

{"human":"This work proposed leveraging GAN and MMD (maximum mean discrepancy) to improve Bayesian parameter estimation methods for quantifying properties of physical systems which cannot be observed directly.\n As far as I understand, this proposes to correct a physical model of the phenomenon to be studied with a learned noise to further match observed data from a real physical system. This refinement step makes sense because there is always a mismatch between physical model outputs and observed data. GAN + MMD is employed to train a neural net that produces augmented noises.\nThis paper tackles a real-world problem regarding an interesting application of machine learning and deep learning in real-world problems. However, in terms of modeling the novelty and contribution are limited because it is a simple combination of GAN and MMD. \nThe way the authors wrote the paper really makes it confusing.

In addition,  the notions used in the section \u201d Generative adversarial networks and the maximum mean discrepancy\u201d are really messy. For example, they use P_y to describe both a distribution (i.e., acting on the measurable set) and density function (i.e., a function from data space to R+) and also the generator G is a map from a point X to a distribution which is different from the original formulation of GAN. Certainly, in terms of modeling, we can do this, but it needs an explanation. \nBelow are some of my questions\n1.\tWhat are the meaning of variables X,Y, \\theta in your problem setting? Does \\theta contain parameters of a physical model of the phenomenon to be studied? Is X the output of this physical model?

However, to facilitate broader adoption and application of this methodology, it is essential to provide comprehensive details regarding the training process. This includes a thorough explanation of hyperparameter selection, which is critical as it influences the model's learning dynamics, convergence criteria that dictate when training should halt, and how stability issues inherent to GANs were addressed. For instance, were there specific techniques employed to stabilize the training process, such as gradient penalty or adaptive learning rates? Documenting any challenges encountered during training\u2014along with the strategies implemented to mitigate these challenges\u2014would significantly enhance the reproducibility and reliability of the results achieved.\n\n2. **Evaluation Metrics**: While the proposed method adeptly addresses the refinement of physical models, a more detailed exposition of the evaluation metrics utilized to assess the model's performance is warranted. Specifically, it would be beneficial to delineate the procedures through which the augmented outputs generated by the model are quantitatively compared with observed data. This may include a discussion on the statistical tests or metrics employed, such as mean squared error or R-squared values, as well as how these benchmarks were established for validation purposes. By offering clearer insights into the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, the authors can better communicate the strengths and limitations of their approach.\n\n3. **Computational Efficiency**: The computational efficiency of the combined GAN and MMD approach is another vital consideration. Given the inherent complexity and resource demands of GANs, it would be advantageous for the authors to provide explicit insights into the computational resources required, including hardware specifications and software environments, alongside the timeframes needed for both training and inference phases. This information is crucial for practitioners who might seek to implement this method in real-world scenarios, allowing them to gauge feasibility and resource allocation effectively.\n\n4. **Generalization Capability**: The paper could significantly strengthen its contributions by exploring the generalization of the proposed method to other physical systems or phenomena beyond those explicitly studied. The inclusion of case studies or simulations that demonstrate the robustness and versatility of the method in diverse contexts would enhance its applicability and relevance. For example, how might this methodology be adapted for use in fields such as fluid dynamics or structural engineering? Such discussions would not only broaden the scope of the research but also highlight potential interdisciplinary applications.\n\n5. **Interpretability of Results**: Interpreting the results generated by GANs is paramount, particularly in scientific contexts where understanding the underlying mechanisms is key to advancing knowledge. It would be beneficial for the authors to elaborate on how the learned noise components and the adjustments made to the physical model can be interpreted in relation to the phenomena being studied. For instance, do certain patterns in the generated data correlate with specific physical behaviors? Discussing these aspects would contribute to a deeper understanding of the model\u2019s insights and implications.\n\n6. **Comparative Analysis**: A comparative analysis with existing techniques for parameter estimation in similar contexts would greatly enhance the understanding of the advantages or limitations of the proposed method. By highlighting how the integration of GANs and MMD results in improvements over traditional parameter estimation methods, the authors could effectively demonstrate the novelty and effectiveness of their approach. This could include comparisons with established methods such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo or other machine learning techniques, detailing specific performance metrics and use-case scenarios.\n\n7. **Potential Applications**: To maximize the impact of this research, it would be valuable to outline specific applications where this methodology could be particularly transformative. Discussing potential fields such as materials science, where the method could elucidate complex material behaviors, climate modeling, which could benefit from improved predictive capabilities, or biomedical applications like disease modeling, would help contextualize its significance and inspire further research endeavors in these domains.\n\n8. **Ethical Considerations**: As with any machine learning approach, particularly those that involve generative models, ethical implications must be carefully considered. A brief discussion on the ethical considerations related to the deployment of GANs in scientific modeling\u2014including issues surrounding data privacy, potential biases in the generated data, and the implications of misuse\u2014would add depth to the discussion. Addressing these concerns is essential to fostering responsible research practices in this rapidly evolving field.\n\n9. **Future Work**: Finally, outlining directions for future research stemming from this work could provide a valuable roadmap for subsequent investigations. Identifying specific challenges that remain unaddressed, such as scalability to larger datasets or the integration of real-time data processing, or proposing new avenues for exploration, such as the application of the methodology to emerging fields like quantum computing, would greatly benefit the research community and encourage further innovation.\n\nIn conclusion, the proposed method represents a promising step towards refining physical models through the application of advanced machine learning techniques. By addressing the aforementioned points, the authors can enhance the clarity and impact of their work, ensuring that it serves as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners alike in the field.","op1":"create","op2":"expand","domain":"openreview","model":"gpt4o_mini"}

{"human":"This work presents an extension of the MAML framework for \"learning to learn.\" This extension changes the space in which \"inner-loop\" gradient steps are taken to adapt the model to a new task, and also introduces stochasticity. The authors validate their proposed method with regression experiments in a toy setting and few-shot classification experiments on mini- and tiered-Imagenet. The latter are well known and competitive benchmarks in few-shot learning.\n\nThe primary innovations that distinguish this work from previous gradient-based approaches to meta-learning (namely MAML) are that (i) the initial set of parameters is data-dependent and drawn from a generative distribution; and (ii) the adaptation of model parameters proceeds in a lower-dimensional latent space rather than in the higher-dimensional parameter space. Specifically, model parameters are generated from a distribution parameterized by an adapted latent code at each adaptation step. I find both of these innovations novel.\n\nThe experimental results, in which LEO outperforms the state of the art on two benchmarks derived from ImageNet by \"comfortable margins,\" and the ablation study demonstrate convincingly that these innovations are also significant. I also found the curvature analysis and embedding visualization illuminating of the model's function. My one suggestion would be to test the model on realistic data from beyond the image domain, perhaps on something sequential like language (consider the few-shot PTB setting from Vinyals et al. (2016)). I'm aware anecdotally that MAML struggles with adapting RNNs and I wonder if LEO overcomes that weakness.\n\nThe paper is clearly written and I had little difficulty in following the algorithmic details, although I'm sure it helped to be familiar with the convoluted meta-learning and inner-\/outer- loop frameworks. I recommend it for publication.\n\nPros:\n- Natural, novel extension to gradient-based meta-learning\n- state of the art results on two competitive few-shot benchmarks\n- good analysis\n- clear writing\n\nCons:\n- realistic, high-dim data is only from the image domain\n\nMinor questions for the authors:\n- Relation Networks are computationally intensive, although in few-shot learning the sets encoded are fairly small. Can you discuss the computational cost and training time of the full framework?\n- What happens empirically when you generate parameters for more than just the output layer in, eg, your convolutional networks?\n- What happens if you try to learn networks from scratch through the meta-learning process rather than pre-training and fine-tuning them? Some of the methods you compare against do so, to my understanding.","LLM_1":"While the conceptual framework is intriguing, the review raises several critical points that warrant attention to strengthen the paper's contribution and clarity.\n\n**Strengths:**\n1. **Novel Conceptual Direction:** The idea of performing adaptation in a learned, potentially lower-dimensional latent space is a compelling departure from standard MAML. This could theoretically offer benefits in terms of optimization stability and computational efficiency, which the authors appropriately highlight.\n2. **Empirical Validation:** The inclusion of both toy regression and standard few-shot image classification benchmarks provides a reasonable scope for initial validation. The results on tiered-ImageNet, in particular, suggest the method can be competitive in more challenging settings.\n\n**Weaknesses and Areas for Improvement:**\n1. **Clarity of Motivation and Mechanism:** The paper would benefit from a more precise explanation of *why* adaptation in latent space is advantageous. A clearer theoretical or intuitive discussion comparing the geometry of the latent space versus the original parameter space would help ground the innovation. For instance, how does the learned transformation mitigate issues like inner-loop gradient pathology or sensitivity to hyperparameters?\n2. **Ablation and Analysis:** The contribution of the stochastic, data-dependent initializer versus the latent-space adaptation is somewhat entangled. A more thorough ablation study separating these two components is necessary to quantify their individual impacts on performance, convergence speed, and robustness.\n3. **Comparison to Relevant Baselines:** While comparisons to MAML and its variants are included, the work should also be contextualized against other meta-learning paradigms that decouple representation learning from fast adaptation (e.g., Prototypical Networks, MetaOptNet) or that use learned optimization (e.g., LSTM optimizers). This would better position the paper within the broader field.\n4. **Technical Details and Reproducibility:** The description of the architecture for the mapping to latent space and the initialization network is somewhat sparse. Providing more details (e.g., network diagrams, explicit formulations of the stochastic process) or releasing code would greatly aid reproducibility and understanding.\n5. **Limitations and Computational Overhead:** The introduction of additional networks for mapping and initialization inevitably increases model complexity. A discussion of the trade-offs in terms of parameter count, training time, and memory footprint compared to vanilla MAML would provide a more balanced view of the method's practicality.\n\n**Questions for the Authors:**\n1. Could you provide more insight into the characteristics of the learned latent space? For example, visualizations or metrics showing its dimensionality reduction or altered loss landscape geometry would be illustrative.\n2. How sensitive is the method to the choice of latent space dimensionality? Was this explored, and what guidance can be offered for setting this hyperparameter?\n3. In the stochastic initialization, how is the task representation computed, and how does the variability in initialization affect the consistency of adaptation across different tasks?\n4. Were there any observed failure modes or datasets where the method underperformed relative to MAML? Understanding the boundaries of the approach's applicability is important.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\nThe proposed method presents a thoughtful extension of gradient-based meta-learning with promising initial results. However, to solidify its contribution, the paper requires deeper analysis to disentangle and justify its core components, more rigorous comparisons, and enhanced clarity in exposition.

{"human":"       This, in a nutshell, is the question Jacob Sullum is trying to address in his  urlLink Reason article . The article opens with the discussion of Kelly Brownell's book,   urlLink Food Fight: The Inside Story of the Food Industry, America\u2019s Obesity Crisis, and What We Can Do About It   (McGraw-Hill). According to Mr Sullum, Mr Brownell is, ironically, quite portly himself, but that is not the main point of the article, just a humourous aside.  According to Mr Sullum, the book comes up with quite a few recommendations as to what the government ought to do to fight the scourge of obesity. Writes Sullum,         The more important question is why any of this is the government\u2019s business. Granted that obesity is a health issue, why is it a  public  health issue? The answer from Brownell and like-minded activists is that the government must rescue consumers -- especially children -- from the environmental forces that make them fat, thereby rescuing taxpayers from the burden of obesity-related medical expenses. They propose to accomplish this mission through a combination of taxes, subsidies, censorship, and regulation. In his book  Food Fight  (co-authored by Katherine Battle Horgen), Brownell says 'profound change is necessary.' Among other things, the government must 'change the basic economics of food,' redesign cities so that 'times, places, and incentives for people to be physically active [are] engineered into daily life,' 'prohibit marketing of products to children,' 'prohibit snack foods and soft drinks from schools,' and 'prohibit the operation of businesses selling food within a certain distance of schools.' If legislatures fail to go along with this agenda, 'litigation may be necessary.'       The war on fat is the latest manifestation of a collectivist philosophy that says the government has a duty to protect 'public health' by discouraging behavior that might lead to disease or injury. It also reflects an anti-capitalist perspective that views people as helpless automatons manipulated into consuming whatever big corporations choose to produce. The anti-fat crusaders want to manipulate us too, but for our own good. They seek to reshape us by reshaping the world.   Jacob Sullum makes a number of convincing arguments as to why the maintenance of one's weight ought to be left up to the individual. I would think that is the right attitude. I think it is legal to fight misrepresentation of products on the part of food manufacturers. I think when a juice manufacturer misstates the sugar content, or when McDonalds fails to inform the public that its French fries are fried in animal fat, that can be cause for litigation. Otherwise, manufacturers are in their right to do what they do best,- make their product and try to market it to the public, and the public must be knowledgeable and responsible enough to know what to consume and when.  I also think it is very dangerous to the society to have governmental intervention in the areas that ought to be controlled by the individual himself. That breeds infantilism and irresponsibility,- the two afflictions from which we already suffer to a significant extent.          ","LLM_1":"advocates seems to hinge on the belief that obesity is not just a personal failing but a societal concern that necessitates intervention. Sullum, however, challenges this notion, questioning why the government's role extends into the eating habits of its citizens. Is it a matter of protecting public health, or does it cross the line into paternalism?\n\nIn addressing the obesity crisis, Brownell and others propose a series of government-led initiatives, from taxing sugary drinks to instituting regulations on food advertising, especially those targeting children. These suggestions often emerge from the premise that societal influences play a significant role in shaping individual choices. Indeed, the food industry has evolved into a complex web of marketing strategies, with unhealthy options often more accessible and more affordable than their healthier counterparts. However, the question remains: should the government step in to dictate dietary choices, or should individuals bear the responsibility for their own health?\n\nSullum posits that while obesity may be a public health issue, the solution does not necessarily lie in government intervention. He suggests that this approach could lead to unintended consequences, such as infringing on personal freedoms. By placing the onus of responsibility on the government, we risk undermining personal agency and the ability to make informed choices. In a free society, individuals should have the right to make decisions about their bodies, even if those choices lead to less-than-desirable health outcomes.\n\nMoreover, the argument for government intervention often overlooks the role of education and personal accountability. Instead of imposing regulations, why not focus on enhancing public education about nutrition and healthy lifestyle choices? Empowering individuals with knowledge could lead to more sustainable behavioral changes than any government mandate might achieve. When people understand the implications of their food choices, they may be more inclined to make healthier decisions without the need for coercive measures.\n\nFurthermore, Sullum draws attention to the potential slippery slope of government involvement in personal health decisions. If obesity warrants intervention, what might be next? Would the government start regulating other lifestyle choices, such as alcohol consumption or smoking? The precedence set by intervening in one aspect of public health could lead to broader implications, effectively creating a society where personal freedoms are constantly at odds with government regulations aimed at ensuring public well-being.\n\nIn this landscape of rising obesity rates, we must also consider the socio-economic factors that contribute to health disparities. Access to healthy food options is not equal across communities; lower-income neighborhoods often lack fresh produce and safe spaces for physical activity. Focusing solely on behavior without addressing systemic inequalities can perpetuate cycles of poor health. Solutions must be multi-faceted, targeting both education and accessibility.\n\nUltimately, the conversation surrounding obesity and government intervention must navigate the delicate balance between public health and individual rights. While the impact of obesity on society cannot be ignored, the methods of addressing it deserve careful scrutiny. Encouraging personal responsibility, promoting education, and addressing socio-economic disparities may prove to be more effective strategies than government regulation. As Sullum aptly points out, we must ask ourselves: where do we draw the line between fostering public health and respecting personal freedom? In seeking solutions, a nuanced approach that respects individual autonomy while advocating for healthier choices may be the most prudent path forward. \n\nIn the end, our challenge is not just to combat obesity but to cultivate a culture that values health and wellness without sacrificing the very freedoms that define us.","LLM_2":"---\n\n### Rethinking Government Intervention in Obesity: A Call for Personal Responsibility\n\nThe discourse around obesity often hinges on the belief that it is not merely a personal failing but a societal issue that requires intervention.

{"human":"My nose twitches, sniffing for danger from my hiding spot behind the couch. I perk up my ears as I hear the clack clack of the monster prowling through my home. The monster has taken my beloved Sarah hostage, and forced her to be it's slave, pushing it around and playing with it's long, sinuous tail. Whimpering nervously, I try to contain my fear. I love Sarah, and I want to protect her, but that monster is ferocious! It moves around unlike anything I've seen, menacingly gliding like a ghost. It's body is hard and shiny like a bug, with a transparent stomach swirling with it's victims bones. It must have some kind of power source that allows it to control her, and it seems strongest when it's howling and screaming. Sarah does n't show any outward realization of the danger she's in, perhaps the creature has hypnotized her to do it's bidding? \n \n \n The monster begins screaming and I wince, the volume hurts my head. Cautiously, I peek around the corner of the couch, worry making me pant. It's so purposeful in it's movements, leaving no square foot of the room untouched, somehow it evens communicates to Sarah and has her move things out of the way so it can move around more. How does it tell her it's desires, is it telepathic? \n \n \n When I left mom, she told me my new home would be a wonderful place, and in many ways it has been. I get fed yummy pebbles twice a day, I have my own grass to play in with my ball, Sarah even gave me a soft bed to sleep in every night. She did n't tell me I'd have to defend my home from monsters that apparently come out to terrorize me regularly. This is n't the first time I've cowered from the beast, and I'm starting to think I need to do something about it since it keeps coming back. I love Sarah and I ca n't keep letting her be tortured! I've made my mind up, time to stop acting like a feline and show what makes canines the best! \n \n Using all my best abilities, I launch my assault. Tapping into my hyper speed, I bolt out from behind the couch and bob and weave my way around the insidious beast, taunting it with my most ferocious bark. My barks are ineffective, the monster rolls on with it's dutiful march unaffected. I slam on the brakes at where I think the front is, and and put on my fiercest look. Head lowered, hackles raised, and my deepest growl rumbling through my clenched teeth. The screaming stops, and Sarah seems to be coming out of her trance, she's trying to scold me like a naughty dog. She must still be in a haze, I'm in the middle of saving her. As she comes around, I see my chance to end this once and for all. I lunge for Sarah and she freezes in shock as I duck between her legs. As I unfurl I take my chance to attack the weakened monster, sitting silently after losing it's grip on it's victim. I chomp down on it's tail as hard as I can, fighting the urge to spit out it's rank flesh. Still maintaining my hold on it's tail, I throw my body down the hall to knock it off balance. The beast topples with an angry crash, helpless to my barrage. I give the tail a good head shake before spitting it out, then pin it's body to the ground to finish it off. Sarah is screaming my praises as I prepare to descend with my death blow, her encouragement fuels my fury. I rip out what I think is the beasts throat, and carry it to Sarah to show her she's safe, once and for all. \n \n As I approach her, she seems angry, but softens as I sit and wait patiently for her to take the prize from me. I let her take the monsters flesh from my mouth, and she pats me on the head and sighs. \n \n `` Good boy Freckles'' she says as she laughs.\n","LLM_1":"high-pitched wail drills into my skull like a burrowing insect, each pulse vibrating through the floorboards and up my trembling paws.

It\u2019s stealing her silence.\n\nI remember how quiet she\u2019s been these past weeks\u2014how she stopped humming while cooking, stopped laughing at bad jokes, stopped saying \u201cI love you\u201d before bed. Each stolen breath of stillness made the creature stronger, until it could wear her movements like a suit.\n\nMy gaze lands on the antique phonograph in the corner\u2014the one Sarah inherited from her mother, long abandoned under dust and grief. It hasn\u2019t played in years, but the records remain. And one, in particular, pulses with a memory brighter than the rest: Sarah\u2019s lullaby, sung in her own voice before the quiet took hold. A song of deep woods and running water, of safety, of home.\n\nIf the monster feeds on scream, perhaps a song can starve it.\n\nWith a breath I didn\u2019t know I was holding, I dart across the open floor, heart hammering against my ribs. The monster whirls, its body cracking like ice, emitting a shriek that shatters the vase on the mantel. Sarah stumbles, dazed, as if waking from a dream.\n\nI leap\u2014not at the beast, but onto the phonograph shelf.

{"human":"## Strength\n- The proposed object-level pre-training method is simple, straightforward, and motivated.\n- The paper is well written and organized, making it easy to read and follow.\n- The method achieves strong performance in COCO semi-supervised setting (5%\/10% training data).\n\n## Weakness\n- The used representation method as in BYOL is not exactly contrastive learning.  The method name in the title and main paper is not appropriate.  In the BYOL paper, the authors distinguish their method from contrastive methods. \n- The fine-tuning experiments are mainly conducted on COCO with a single architecture Mask R-CNN. But the pre-training should be general, even in the single task of object detection. To prevent overfitting a single dataset and a single arch. The authors are suggested to experiment with different datasets, e.g., Cityscapes, and different architectures, e.g., RetinaNet and FCOS. For different archs, you can just extract the pre-trained backbone and compare it to supervised or other self-supervised methods.\n- The proposed method performs worse than the previous method PixPro on VOC.\n- In Table 4, why does FPN make the performance worse?\n\n## Others\n- Did you try pre-training on non-object-centric datasets like COCO? The paper only reports results on ImageNet which is object-centric. I guess that's also why you can only set a small K for each image. It would be more interesting if the method can benefit more from data like COCO.\n\n## After Rebuttal\nThe rebuttal has addressed all my concerns.

{"human":"I would like to thank the authors for the rebuttal. The added experiments have made this work better.\n\nWhile the collection of training data still seems hard (require exponential computation), I like the idea and the new experiments on generalizing from small training size to large ones. I still think the application domain of the proposed work is limited. The application to quantum computing is definitely interesting, but adiabatic scheduling is a more restricted domain and the contribution in this work is not applicable to gate-based quantum computers explored by Google, IBM, Rigetti, etc.\n\nBecause the revised manuscript is stronger now, I have modified my rating accordingly.\n\n##########################################################################\n\nSummary:\n\nThis paper concerns a specific application of machine learning in quantum computing: training classical machine learning models to predict the optimal schedule in adiabatic quantum computation. Adiabatic quantum computation depends greatly on the schedule to achieve good quantum speed-up. While in various cases, the optimal schedule is known. There will be instances where the optimal schedule is unknown, and the work proposes predicting those optimal schedules using neural networks. The main contribution comes from designing a new loss function for training such a model.\n\n##########################################################################\n\nReasons for score: \n\nI think the application is relatively narrow, even within the field of machine learning\/quantum physics. The proposed neural architectures are very standard. The novelty comes from how to define a good loss function. The loss function is well-motivated and the empirical performances are convincing. However, the contribution may be too specific to be used in other machine learning\/quantum physics applications, so I think most audiences attending ICLR may not be very interested in this result.\n \n##########################################################################Pros: \n\nPros:\n \n1. The proposed loss function is well-motivated.\n\n2. The proposed method works well on a wide range of tasks (QUBO, Grover search, 3-SAT).\n \n \n##########################################################################\n\nCons: \n\n 1. The application of the contribution of this work is relatively narrow (producing schedules for adiabatic quantum computation).\n\n\n2. The problem size tested by this work is small (6, 8, and 10). The QUBO problems that can be solved by current quantum devices (such as D-Wave machines) seems to be much larger (bigger than 1000).\n\n\n3. The proposed machine learning approach can not be used for larger n (e.g., n > 100) because the input to the classical neural network is a 2^n vector. If this scalability issue can not be addressed, then the proposed method would not be useful in practice (any form of quantum advantage would become vacuous if we need an exponential preprocessing time to find the schedule).\n\n \n##########################################################################\n\nQuestions during the rebuttal period: \n\n\n1. I have some concerns about the scalability of the proposed technique as discussed in the Cons section. The input to the neural network is a 2^n dimension vector. Do the authors have ideas and supporting evidence for how one could scale to a large system when n is like 50~100?\n\n2. Are there other non-ML alternatives to the linear schedule that people employ in practice? If the importance of scheduling is as claimed, I believe there should be extensive literature studying heuristics scheduling for QUBO and 3SAT. How does the proposed ML method compare to these existing heuristics?","LLM_1":"### **Strengths and Detailed Feedback**\n\n1. **Methodological Rigor and Experimental Design:**\n   - The revised experiments, particularly those demonstrating generalization from small to large system sizes, are compelling and significantly bolster the paper's core claim. The careful construction of training sets at varying scales and the clear presentation of scaling laws provide valuable empirical evidence for the model's transferability.\n   - The ablation studies on model architecture choices (e.g., graph neural networks versus simpler baselines) are well-placed and help isolate the source of the performance gains. It would be beneficial to see a brief discussion on the computational cost of inference with the trained model versus a traditional solver for a single instance, even if training is expensive, to fully contextualize the trade-off.\n\n2. **Clarity and Presentation:**\n   - The manuscript is generally well-written. The problem formulation in Section 2 is now clearer. I suggest the authors add a small schematic or a more concrete minimal example (e.g., a 3-qubit system) in the main text or appendix to visually illustrate the adiabatic scheduling problem and the mapping to a graph structure. This would greatly improve accessibility for readers at the intersection of ML and quantum physics.\n\n3. **Potential for Broader Impact:**\n   - While the application is currently specialized, the underlying methodology\u2014learning to predict parameters for physical processes governed by differential equations or optimization landscapes\u2014could inspire similar approaches in other domains. The authors should consider adding a short paragraph in the discussion explicitly outlining these potential parallels (e.g., control problems in classical dynamical systems, material design) to frame the work's conceptual contribution beyond quantum computing.\n\n### **Weaknesses and Areas for Improvement**\n\n1. **Scope and Generality Claims:**\n   - The title and abstract should be slightly tempered to more accurately reflect the specific domain of adiabatic quantum computing (AQC). A phrase like \"for adiabatic quantum schedules\" or \"in quantum annealing\" would prevent misunderstanding regarding applicability to the broader, gate-model quantum computation ecosystem.\n   - The discussion section should more forthrightly address the limitations imposed by the AQC paradigm. Acknowledging that error correction, gate fidelity, and other central challenges in gate-based models are not addressed here would strengthen the paper's scholarly honesty and help readers precisely situate its contribution.\n\n2. **Robustness and Failure Modes:**\n   - The experiments show success on a defined class of problem instances. The review would be strengthened by a dedicated analysis of *when* or *on what types of instances* the model might fail or underperform. For example, are there particular graph topologies or disorder strengths in the spin-glass problems that degrade performance? A brief analysis of the model's confidence (e.g., via predictive variance if using a probabilistic model) could be insightful.\n\n3. **Comparison Baselines:**\n   - The comparison to traditional optimization solvers is good. However, including a comparison to a simple, adaptive heuristic schedule (e.g., a linear ramp with a locally optimized pause) as an additional baseline would make the ML model's advantage even more concrete. Demonstrating that the model outperforms not just brute-force search but also sensible hand-designed policies would be powerful.\n\n4. **Data Efficiency and Dependency:**\n   - The exponential cost of generating training data remains a fundamental limitation. The authors should provide a more quantitative discussion: for an N-qubit system, how many training instances were needed to achieve the reported generalization? A plot showing performance versus training set size for a fixed N could illuminate the data efficiency of the approach.\n\n### **Questions for the Authors**\n\n1. Given the cost of generating training data, does the proposed method become advantageous only after a certain number of repeated computations on similarly structured problems? Could you quantify a \"break-even\" point?\n2. The model predicts an optimal schedule. Have you explored or considered an iterative, closed-loop approach where the model suggests a schedule, a physical simulation (or actual hardware) provides a result, and this feedback is used to refine future predictions? This could mitigate data generation costs.\n3. In the spin-glass experiments, what is the assumed hardware model? Are you accounting for specific physical constraints of real annealers (e.g., D-Wave\u2019s qubit connectivity) in your graph construction, or is this a more abstract, idealized setting?\n\n### **Recommendation**\n\nThe revisions have substantially improved the manuscript. The work presents a novel and technically sound application of machine learning to a challenging problem in quantum optimization. While its immediate applicability is to the adiabatic\/annealing paradigm, the quality of the empirical validation and the potential methodological insights warrant publication. I recommend acceptance, contingent on the authors addressing the points above, particularly those regarding the clarification of scope and a more detailed discussion of limitations. My final rating reflects this positive assessment of the strengthened contribution.","LLM_2":"### **Strengths and Detailed Feedback**\n\n1. **Methodological Rigor and Experimental Design:**  \n   - The revised experiments, especially those illustrating generalization from small to large system sizes, are convincing and substantially reinforce the paper\u2019s central argument. The deliberate design of training sets across different scales and the clear articulation of scaling laws offer strong empirical support for the model\u2019s transferability.  \n   - The ablation studies on architectural choices (e.g., graph neural networks vs. simpler baselines) are well-executed and help pinpoint the origins of performance improvements. To better frame the practical trade-offs, it would be useful to briefly discuss the computational cost of inference with the trained model compared to a traditional solver for a single instance\u2014even if training remains expensive.\n\n2. **Clarity and Presentation:**  \n   - The manuscript is generally well-written, and the problem formulation in Section 2 is now clearer.

{"human":"           My good buddy and co-worker, Celeste, yawns a lot.  And I'm not exaggerating--I mean  A LOT .  (Don't try to deny it, Celeste.)  I really wouldn't care, except that being around her all day makes me yawn, too.  Yes, I have that contagious thing.  The librarian\/researcher in me just had to know why.  Here's what I came up with:   Why do we yawn?  The truth is that we don't completely understand why people, or animals for that matter, yawn.  It's widely assumed that yawning occurs because we are tired or bored or because we see someone else doing it, but there isn't any hard evidence to support these beliefs.  Scientists do not purport to know all of the biological mechanisms of the yawn, but tend to agree that a yawn is an involuntary respiratory reflex, which regulates the carbon dioxide and oxygen levels in the blood.  Technically, a yawn is the reflex opening of the mouth followed by the deep inhalation and slow exhalation of oxygen.  The very act of yawning is but one of a number of involuntary reflexes controlled by the spinal and nerve centers.  Scientists speculate that the onset of a yawn is triggered either by fatigue, or by sheer boredom as, at those times, breathing is shallow, and little oxygen is carried to the lungs by the oxygen-toting cardiovascular system.  When one yawns, his or her alertness is heightened, as the sudden intake of oxygen increases the heart rate, rids the lungs and the bloodstream of the carbon dioxide buildup, and forces oxygen through blood vessels in the brain, while restoring normal breathing and ventilating the lungs.  This quite plausible theory of yawning falls short of explaining many aspect of yawning.  Scientists explain away the 'contagious' nature of yawning, that is when one person's yawn triggers another nearby to yawn, as due to the power of suggestion, but are at a loss when attempting to explain why yawning occurs excessively in patients with lower brainstem damage or with multiple sclerosis.  Other unlocked mysteries include why fetuses in the womb yawn, when it is a well-known fact that they do not intake oxygen in to their lungs until after live birth, or why individuals with high concentrations of oxygen in their blood streams yawn.  Until these questions are answered, do not assume that a person who yawns in your presence is bored with what you are saying, or suffers from exhaustion.  Simply be pleased that he or she is not bored to death.   Now, how many times did you yawn during that little gem?    At least I'm happy to know that Celeste isn't yawning at me all the time because I'm boring her!!!    HEAVEN FORBID!!!           ","LLM_1":"mechanisms behind yawning, but that hasn\u2019t stopped them from coming up with some pretty fascinating theories. One of the more compelling ones suggests that yawning helps regulate brain temperature. Yes, you read that right\u2014your gaping maw might actually be a built-in cooling system. Researchers at the University of Vienna found that people yawn more frequently in cooler environments than in warmer ones, and that doing something as simple as pressing a cold pack to your forehead can significantly reduce yawning. The idea is that when your brain starts to overheat\u2014maybe from intense thinking, stress, or even sleepiness\u2014yawning pulls in a big gulp of cool air, increases heart rate, and boosts blood flow, all of which help carry heat away from the brain. So next time Celeste lets out one of her signature cavernous yawns, she might not be bored\u2014she could be rebooting her mental CPU.\n\nBut here\u2019s where it gets even weirder: contagious yawning may be linked to empathy. Studies show that we\u2019re far more likely to catch a yawn from someone we know or care about than from a stranger. Kids don\u2019t start \u201ccatching\u201d yawns until around age four or five\u2014the same time they begin developing theory of mind, or the ability to understand that others have thoughts and feelings different from their own. Even more telling? People on the autism spectrum, who often struggle with social cues and empathy, are less susceptible to contagious yawning. Chimpanzees, bonobos, and even dogs yawn contagiously\u2014but only around individuals they\u2019re bonded with. So maybe my constant mimicking of Celeste isn\u2019t just a reflex; maybe it\u2019s a subconscious sign that I\u2019m emotionally in sync with her. (Aw, that\u2019s almost sweet. Don\u2019t let it go to your head, Celeste.)\n\nThen again, not all scientists buy into the empathy angle. Some argue that attention plays a bigger role\u2014if you\u2019re focused on someone, you\u2019re more likely to notice their yawn and, thanks to subtle mirror neurons firing in your brain, unconsciously mimic it. In fact, simply reading about yawning can set it off. (Sorry if you just yawned. You\u2019re welcome if you didn\u2019t.) These mirror neurons, which fire both when we perform an action and when we see someone else do it, might explain why athletes visualize success or why we flinch when we see someone get hurt. Yawning could just be another quirk of our deeply imitative brains.\n\nAnd speaking of quirks, did you know that the average yawn lasts about six seconds? That\u2019s an eternity in biological terms. During that time, your facial muscles stretch, your eardrums flex, your spine may even realign slightly, and your oxygen intake spikes\u2014though surprisingly, studies show blood oxygen levels don\u2019t actually change much afterward. So it\u2019s not really about gas exchange, despite what your high school biology teacher might\u2019ve said. It\u2019s more about state regulation\u2014shifting your body from low alertness to high readiness, like a soft reboot for your nervous system.\n\nYawning shows up in some unexpected places, too. Expectant mothers report increased yawning during early pregnancy, possibly due to hormonal shifts and rising core temperatures. Soldiers yawn before combat missions, not out of boredom, but likely from anticipation and stress. Even fetuses yawn in the womb\u2014ultrasounds confirm it\u2014though there\u2019s no air to breathe and certainly no coworkers to annoy. This has led some researchers to believe yawning plays a role in development, perhaps helping to shape the jaw or stimulate circulation in utero.\n\nSo while we still don\u2019t have a definitive answer, one thing\u2019s clear: yawning is far more complex than a signal for sleep. It\u2019s a physiological multitasker\u2014cooling, connecting, preparing, and developing. And as for me? I\u2019ll keep yawning alongside Celeste, not because I\u2019m tired, but because, in a weird way, it ties us together. Science, friendship, and involuntary reflexes\u2014what more could you ask for in a workday?","LLM_2":"**The Science Behind Yawning: Why We Do It (And Why It\u2019s Contagious)**\n\nWe\u2019ve all been there\u2014mid-conversation, someone yawns, and suddenly, like dominoes falling, we\u2019re fighting back our own. Yawning is one of those universal human quirks that feels automatic, almost silly\u2026 but beneath its unassuming surface lies a surprisingly complex web of biology, emotion, and even social connection.\n\nDespite how common it is, scientists still don\u2019t have a single definitive answer for *why* we yawn. But that hasn\u2019t stopped them from developing some fascinating theories\u2014one of which might just reframe your next big yawn as an act of genius-level brain maintenance.\n\n### Your Brain\u2019s Built-In Cooling System?\n\nHere\u2019s a mind-bender: yawning might be your body\u2019s way of keeping your brain from overheating. That\u2019s right\u2014your dramatic jaw stretch could double as a natural air conditioner. Research from the University of Vienna suggests that people yawn more often in cooler environments than warm ones. Even more telling? Pressing a cold pack to your forehead can cut down on yawns significantly.\n\nThe theory goes like this: when your brain temperature creeps up\u2014thanks to mental strain, fatigue, or stress\u2014a well-timed yawn pulls in a rush of cool air. This boosts heart rate, increases blood flow, and helps shuttle heat away from the brain. So the next time Celeste unleashes one of her legendary, jaw-cracking yawns, she\u2019s not zoning out\u2014she\u2019s basically rebooting her neural operating system.\n\n### The Empathy Effect: Why Yawns Are Contagious\n\nNow, here\u2019s where things get even more interesting: we don\u2019t just yawn when we\u2019re tired\u2014we yawn when others do. And this contagious effect isn\u2019t random. Studies show we\u2019re much more likely to \u201ccatch\u201d a yawn from someone we know or care about than from a stranger.\n\nChildren typically don\u2019t start mirroring yawns until around age four or five\u2014the same period when they begin to develop *theory of mind*, the ability to recognize that others have thoughts and feelings different from their own. Even more revealing? People on the autism spectrum, who often experience differences in social processing and empathy, are less likely to catch yawns. \n\nAnd it\u2019s not just humans. Chimpanzees, bonobos, and even dogs exhibit contagious yawning\u2014but only with individuals they\u2019re emotionally bonded to. So if you find yourself mimicking your partner, pet, or best friend mid-yawn, it might not be habit. It could be a quiet, subconscious signal of emotional attunement. (Okay, fine\u2014that\u2019s kind of sweet. Don\u2019t get used to me saying that, Celeste.)\n\nOf course, not everyone buys the empathy argument. Some researchers believe attention\u2014not emotion\u2014is the real driver. If you're focused on someone, you're more likely to notice their yawn, and thanks to mirror neurons\u2014brain cells that fire both when we act and when we observe others acting\u2014you might unconsciously copy them. These same neurons are why athletes visualize victory or why we wince at someone else\u2019s pain. In that sense, contagious yawning might just be another quirk of our deeply imitative brains.\n\n(And yes\u2014if reading this made you yawn, you can thank\u2014or blame\u2014those sneaky mirror neurons. You\u2019re welcome either way.)\n\n### Six Seconds of Biological Magic\n\nLet\u2019s talk timing: the average yawn lasts about six seconds. In biological terms, that\u2019s practically an eternity. During those few moments, your face undergoes a full stretch routine\u2014jaw drops, facial muscles engage, eardrums flex, and even your spine gets a subtle reset. Oxygen intake spikes dramatically\u2026 yet oddly, blood oxygen levels barely budge afterward.\n\nSo no, it\u2019s not really about breathing in more oxygen, contrary to what many of us learned in high school biology. Instead, yawning appears to be about *state regulation*\u2014shifting your nervous system from low alertness to high readiness. Think of it as a soft reboot, a physiological nudge that says, \u201cHey, time to wake up.\u201d\n\n### Yawning Across Life\u2014and Before It\n\nYawning shows up in some unexpected moments. Pregnant women often report increased yawning in early pregnancy, possibly linked to hormonal shifts and rising core temperatures. Soldiers yawn before missions\u2014not from boredom, but from the tension and anticipation of what\u2019s ahead. \n\nAnd perhaps most intriguingly: fetuses yawn in the womb. Ultrasounds confirm it, even though there\u2019s no air to inhale and zero coworkers to annoy. This has led some experts to believe yawning plays a developmental role\u2014perhaps helping to shape facial muscles, stimulate circulation, or prepare the nervous system for life outside the uterus.\n\n### More Than Just Tired Eyes\n\nSo while science hasn\u2019t pinned down a single, ironclad reason for yawning, one thing is clear: it\u2019s far more than a sign of sleepiness. It\u2019s a multitasking marvel\u2014cooling the brain, strengthening social bonds, priming the body for action, and even shaping development before birth.\n\nAs for me? I\u2019ll keep catching Celeste\u2019s yawns, not because I\u2019m exhausted, but because, in its own strange, involuntary way, it reminds me how deeply connected we are\u2014to each other, to our bodies, and to the quiet wonders of everyday biology.\n\nScience, friendship, and a good yawn\u2014really, what else do you need to power through the workday?","op1":"create","op2":"rewrite","domain":"blog","model":"Qwen"}
{"human":"Activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in the striatum is crucial for long-term behavioral alterations induced by drugs of abuse. In response to cocaine, ERK phosphorylation (i.e., activation) is restricted to medium-sized spiny neurons expressing dopamine D1 receptor (D1R) and depends on a concomitant stimulation of D1R and glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR). However, the mechanisms responsible for this activation, especially the respective contribution of D1R and NMDAR, remain unknown.We studied striatal neurons in culture stimulated with D1R agonist and\/or glutamate and wild-type or genetically modified mice treated with cocaine. Biochemical, immunohistochemical, and imaging studies were performed. Mice were also subjected to behavioral experiments.Stimulation of D1R cannot activate ERK by itself but potentiates glutamate-mediated calcium influx through NMDAR that is responsible for ERK activation. Potentiation of NMDAR by D1R depends on a cyclic adenosine monophosphate-independent signaling pathway, which involves tyrosine phosphorylation of the NR2B subunit of NMDAR by Src family kinases. We also demonstrate that the D1R\/Src family kinases\/NR2B pathway is responsible for ERK activation by cocaine in vivo. Inhibition of this pathway abrogates cocaine-induced locomotor sensitization and conditioned place preference.","LLM_1":"dopamine and glutamate receptors, particularly NMDA and metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5).

Using cell-type-specific knockout mice, we show that deletion of *Mek1* selectively in D1R-positive neurons abolishes cocaine-mediated ERK phosphorylation and attenuates behavioral sensitization and conditioned place preference. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of mGluR5 or NMDAR activity blocks ERK activation and associated chromatin remodeling marked by increased histone H3 acetylation at the *Fosb* promoter. We also identify a critical role for synaptic plasticity, as disruption of ERK signaling impairs long-term potentiation in the nucleus accumbens following repeated cocaine exposure. These findings highlight the necessity of ERK-dependent transcriptional and epigenetic regulation in D1R neurons for the development of persistent drug-associated behaviors, providing mechanistic insight into the neuroadaptations underlying addiction.","LLM_2":"---\n\nDopamine and glutamate receptors, particularly NMDA receptors (NMDARs) and metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5), play critical roles in cocaine-induced neuroadaptations.

{"human":"The paper is well written in general and has made concrete contribution to the fundamental problem in deep learning. The authors studied learning a single neuron with a bias term with the ReLU activation via gradient methods, which is of central interest in the theory of deep learning. They provided some failure cases to demonstrate the differences from the non-bias case. They also characterized all the critical points of the objective function and provided positive convergence results under several different assumptions.\n\nMy major concerns are as follows: Given the results from the previous work Yehudai and Shamir (2020), the results in this paper are not that surprising and less inspiring. The theoretical contribution is limited in this sense and the analysis can be seen as extension of Yehudai and Shamir (2020). The analysis has less insight compared to the previous work. The authors may analyze more complex network structure, which may give more fundamentally different optimization geometry.","LLM_1":"1. **Clarity of Presentation**: The authors have done an admirable job in articulating their methodology and results. However, there are occasions where the text could benefit from additional clarity. For instance, the explanation of the gradient descent algorithm applied to the single neuron model could be elaborated upon, particularly in terms of the convergence properties and the implications of the chosen learning rates on performance. A clearer discussion of these aspects would enhance the reader's understanding and facilitate replication of the study.\n\n2. **Theoretical Contributions**: While the empirical results are significant, the theoretical implications of the findings could be more deeply explored. The paper mentions the role of the bias term in affecting the learning dynamics, yet it stops short of linking these observations to broader theoretical frameworks in deep learning. A discussion on how these results contribute to existing theories or models of neural network training would strengthen the paper's impact and provide readers with a more comprehensive view of its significance.\n\n3. **Experimental Design**: The experiments conducted are robust, but there is a lack of diversity in the datasets used. Testing the proposed methods on a wider range of datasets, including those with varying distributions and complexities, would provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the model's generalizability. Additionally, including comparisons with other activation functions besides ReLU could further illuminate the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed approach.\n\n4. **Limitations and Future Work**: The authors briefly mention some limitations of their work, but a more in-depth discussion would be beneficial. Acknowledging potential pitfalls or constraints in the study, such as the sensitivity of the model to initialization or the stability of learning under different conditions, would provide a more balanced view. Furthermore, outlining a clear path for future work, perhaps by suggesting extensions to multi-neuron systems or integration with other learning paradigms, would serve to inspire subsequent research efforts.\n\n5. **Real-World Applications**: The practical implications of this research are intriguing but underexplored. The authors could enhance the paper by including a section that discusses potential applications of the single neuron model in real-world scenarios, such as in signal processing or decision-making systems. This could help bridge the gap between theoretical contributions and practical utility, thereby appealing to a broader audience.\n\n6. **Figures and Visual Aids**: The inclusion of figures and visual aids is commendable, as they help in understanding complex concepts. However, some figures lack sufficient detail in their captions. Providing more descriptive captions and ensuring that all figures are referred to adequately within the text would improve the overall clarity and usability of the paper.\n\n7. **Related Work**: While the paper references some relevant literature, a more comprehensive review of related work would strengthen the authors' positioning within the field. Highlighting how their contributions compare with previous studies, particularly those addressing similar problems, would provide context and underscore the novelty of their approach.\n\n8. **Mathematical Rigor**: The mathematical formulations presented are sound, yet there are moments where additional rigor could be applied.

Addressing these points would not only solidify the findings but also make the paper a valuable resource for both researchers and practitioners in the field of deep learning.\n\nIn conclusion, I recommend that the authors consider these suggestions to further elevate the quality of their work and its contribution to the literature.","LLM_2":"1. **Clarity of Presentation**: The authors have done an admirable job in articulating their methodology and results. However, there are occasions where the text could benefit from additional clarity. For instance, the explanation of the gradient descent algorithm applied to the single neuron model could be elaborated upon, particularly in terms of the convergence properties and the implications of the chosen learning rates on performance. A clearer discussion of these aspects would enhance the reader's understanding and facilitate replication of the study. For example, including a comparison of various learning rates and their effect on convergence speed and stability could provide valuable insights. Additionally, discussing potential pitfalls, such as overshooting or getting stuck in local minima, would enrich this section.\n\n2. **Theoretical Contributions**: While the empirical results are significant, the theoretical implications of the findings could be more deeply explored. The paper mentions the role of the bias term in affecting the learning dynamics, yet it stops short of linking these observations to broader theoretical frameworks in deep learning. A discussion on how these results contribute to existing theories or models of neural network training would strengthen the paper's impact. It would be beneficial to reference specific models or theories, such as the universal approximation theorem or convergence theorems, to contextualize the findings and underscore their relevance in advancing our understanding of neural networks.\n\n3. **Experimental Design**: The experiments conducted are robust, but there is a lack of diversity in the datasets used. Testing the proposed methods on a wider range of datasets, including those with varying distributions and complexities, would provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the model's generalizability. For instance, incorporating datasets from different domains, such as image recognition or natural language processing, could reveal how the model performs under various conditions. Additionally, including comparisons with other activation functions besides ReLU, such as Leaky ReLU or ELU, could further illuminate the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed approach, leading to a more nuanced discussion of its applicability.\n\n4. **Limitations and Future Work**: The authors briefly mention some limitations of their work, but a more in-depth discussion would be beneficial. Acknowledging potential pitfalls or constraints in the study, such as the sensitivity of the model to initialization or the stability of learning under different conditions, would provide a more balanced view. Furthermore, outlining a clear path for future work, perhaps by suggesting extensions to multi-neuron systems or integration with other learning paradigms, would serve to inspire subsequent research efforts. For example, proposing a roadmap for incorporating dropout or batch normalization could highlight avenues for improving model robustness and performance.\n\n5. **Real-World Applications**: The practical implications of this research are intriguing but underexplored. The authors could enhance the paper by including a section that discusses potential applications of the single neuron model in real-world scenarios, such as in signal processing or decision-making systems. Delving into specific use cases, such as time series forecasting or anomaly detection in industrial systems, could help bridge the gap between theoretical contributions and practical utility, thereby appealing to a broader audience. Furthermore, discussing how this model could be adapted for use in edge computing or embedded systems would demonstrate its versatility and relevance in current technological contexts.\n\n6. **Figures and Visual Aids**: The inclusion of figures and visual aids is commendable, as they help in understanding complex concepts. However, some figures lack sufficient detail in their captions. Providing more descriptive captions and ensuring that all figures are referred to adequately within the text would improve the overall clarity and usability of the paper. For example, including a brief explanation of what each figure represents and how it relates to the findings discussed would enhance comprehension. Additionally, incorporating visual comparisons of model performance under different conditions could help readers grasp the nuances of the results more effectively.\n\n7. **Related Work**: While the paper references some relevant literature, a more comprehensive review of related work would strengthen the authors' positioning within the field. Highlighting how their contributions compare with previous studies, particularly those addressing similar problems, would provide context and underscore the novelty of their approach. Including a discussion on how their findings align or contrast with established research could also enrich the narrative. For example, comparing their results with recent advancements in neural network optimization techniques may illuminate areas where their approach offers unique insights or improvements.\n\n8. **Mathematical Rigor**: The mathematical formulations presented are sound, yet there are moments where additional rigor could be applied. For example, a more detailed derivation of key equations or assumptions made within the model would enhance the paper's credibility. Including proofs or justifications for the main claims would be especially beneficial for readers who seek a deeper understanding of the underlying principles. Moreover, addressing potential limitations of the mathematical models used, such as assumptions about data distributions, could provide a more robust framework for evaluating the study's conclusions.\n\n9. **Conclusion**: The conclusion effectively summarizes the main findings but could benefit from a more reflective tone regarding the broader implications of the work. Discussing how these insights might influence future research directions or the evolution of deep learning methodologies would provide a more compelling closing argument. Additionally, emphasizing the potential societal impacts of advancements in neural network training could resonate with a wider audience, highlighting the importance of the research beyond academic circles.\n\n10. **Overall Impression**: In summary, this paper presents a significant advancement in understanding the learning dynamics of a single neuron with a bias term using ReLU activation. It is well-structured and generally accessible, but there are areas for improvement that could enhance its clarity, depth, and impact. Addressing these points would not only solidify the findings but also make the paper a valuable resource for both researchers and practitioners in the field of deep learning. By refining these aspects, the authors can significantly elevate the quality of their work, making it a more influential contribution to the literature.\n\nIn conclusion, I recommend that the authors consider these suggestions to further elevate the quality of their work and its contribution to the literature.","op1":"create","op2":"expand","domain":"openreview","model":"gpt4o_mini"}

{"human":"I didn \u2019 t bother powering up the suit. It was only a four minute walk through the cave system back to the room that I had found earlier. The one that had shocked me so badly when I had forced open the door. Its three dead guards laid on the floor, and the door, completely removed from its hinges, sat propped up against a wall. \n \n I took several steps in and took a look at the contents of the room. There was a table with several computers and boxes. Another table with various notebooks and folders. Another table had a rather crude-looking chemistry lab set up on it. \n \n But what had shocked me the most was what had been stacked in the room against the far wall. I walked over, just to be absolutely sure it was what I thought it was. \n \n Canisters, chemical weaponry. I saw labels. Sarin, VX, even mustard gas. There must have been dozens, maybe over a hundred of them stacked neatly against the wall. \n \n The bastards. They had been losing ground even before I stepped in. They knew they were doomed. And somehow they \u2019 d gotten a hold of these. They must have planned to use it as a last weapon of revenge before they were defeated completely. \n \n Many times I had wondered how many had died at my hand. Sometimes I was wracked with guilt. ISIL, they were barbarians of the worst sort, sure. But had they not all started out as men? Men who either willingly joined or by circumstance were impressed into the ranks from conquered towns, fought for an ideology that was a sick mockery of Islam itself? I \u2019 d often wondered, was I right to take so many lives. To decide to who lived and who died. \n \n But as I stood there, looking at how much of these chemical stockpiles they had stored up, I could only think now. \n \n How many lives did I just save? \n \n I had no question that they probably had stockpiles hidden elsewhere. But I sincerely doubted that they were anything of this size and magnitude. And from the looks of the chemistry lab in the room, it looked as if they \u2019 d been trying to synthesize more. \n \n It was a wonder they hadn \u2019 t all gotten themselves killed- storing it under these conditions. \n \n But now this presented me with a major problem. \n \n I quickly grabbed an empty cardboard box. I started piling in notebooks, journals, file folders, loose papers, anything that looked related to this stuff. With any luck it would lead to where and how they had gotten the stuff and so much of it in the first place. I even tore apart the computers and pulled out the hard drives. Anything with any information whatsoever, it was leaving with me. \n \n The box was filled to the brim when I was finally done. I turned back to the stockpile of chemical weapons. Agents of death long-banned under use of conventional warfare, due to the abject pain and cruelty they inflicted, so horrendous that many considered it immoral even in wartime. \n \n A very major problem. \n \n I couldn \u2019 t just leave these here. \n \n Once ISIL finished its inevitable collapse, people would begin to comb their bases more thoroughly. Sooner or later, someone would find this place. It was just a question of when and who. The Syrian Government? The PKK? The Iraqi Police? Turkish forces? The U.S or Russia? \n \n I didn \u2019 t trust any of them with such horrible weapons. Fact of the matter was, I didn \u2019 t trust anyone would actually destroy all of these if they found them. No. Some of those canisters would just happen to go missing, and eventually wind up in the hands of some of the last people who should have access to them. \n \n No. They had to be destroyed. Right here, right now. \n \n But proper disposal of chemical agents was not something I was skilled in. \n \n But I knew of one way. \n \n I had done it once before. But it had been involuntary. The question was could I do it again and could I survive? \n \n And the bigger question: would this action make things worse? \n \n A voice in my head told me that it certainly wouldn \u2019 t lower the sum result of the equation if it was done. There was even a significant probability that it would improve it, it said. \n \n I checked my clock. Finally, twenty minutes had passed. It was time to take action. \n \n I began to power up the suit. I made some rough calculations on what would be necessary to create a contained reaction that wouldn \u2019 t end the world. \n \n A voice in my head made some corrections and I followed them, realizing my error. \n \n The suit powered up to 89.3612 % of the maximum power output. At that point, time seemed to stand still. \n \n A flick of my finger was all that I needed. A spark appeared, and then a ball of fire began to slowly expand, the atoms in the air colliding at such high speed that it created and explosive force. \n \n I continued to power up the suit even more, not daring to move a muscle beyond that. \n \n I then heard the howling of the void envelop me as it did once more. The sound of pure vacuum coupled with raw electricity. \n \n And then there was nothingness. \n \n -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - \n \n \n To be continued in **Chapter 11: Theorum of the One Constant and an Angel's Wrath**\n","LLM_1":"As I stood there, taking in everything, my mind began to reel with thoughts of what could have happened if I hadn't stumbled upon this room, if these chemicals had fallen into wrong hands.

Sweat dripped down my face, a mix of fear and adrenaline coursing through my veins. Suddenly, I heard footsteps echoing from outside, growing louder with each passing moment. Footsteps, not the usual creaks and groans of this old cave, these were deliberate, heavy, almost as if someone was trying to announce their arrival.\n\nI instinctively reached for my rifle, checking my surroundings, making sure I wasn't walking into an ambush. A small window, partially hidden by the stack of canisters caught my attention. Through it, the faint light of daybreak seeped in - it couldn't be more than an hour before dawn. That was when the footsteps stopped. Silence enveloped the space, broken only by my own ragged breathing.

{"human":"I awoke one morning with a new set of feelings. I figured out if I focused on this set of feelings, I could determine what they were. They were full of confusion and desperation. If I focused hard on these feelings, I could see a lab. I could also see a pane of glass that looked like it was a one way mirror, like the kind you would see in an FBI movie. I saw what appeared to be medical equipment hooked up to arms, that were similiar to my own. \n \n I started to think about this situation. I had been involved in a cloning project in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The scientist told me they had scrapped the whole project and burned all my DNA samples. The government had mandated no human cloning due to ethical issues. I began researching the scientist that were in charge of me while I had given DNA samples to the organization. His name was Johnathan Tin. I looked him up on Google and found he was still alive and producing research on cloning still. I found his phone number and email online in one of his articles. I decided to give him a call. \n \n When he picked up, I heard his voice twice. Once through the phone, and once through my new set of feelings. \n \n `` Hello, this is Johnathan Tin, how can I help ya?'' He answered. \n \n `` Hey, this is Cazo Trinity, remember me from the research project back in the 80s?'' \n \n `` Yeah! How you been Cazo?'' He sounded nervous in his voice. \n \n `` I've been good. I would like to know when I get cloned though.'' \n \n `` I, er, I have no idea what you're speaking of!''

I thought the government shut all of this down when we did this back in the early 90s?'' \n \n `` Well, kinda, they told all the participants that, and the world. Only a select few of scientist know about this.'' \n \n `` Well, where are you located? I will come as soon as I can.'' \n \n `` You remember the old research building near the CDC in Atlanta?'' \n \n `` Yeah?'' \n \n `` That is where we are. You'll be able to walk right in.

When I arrive it looks like it was built yesterday, they must have one hell of a custodian crew. I walked up to the door, and like he said, there was a fingerprint scanner. I placed my finger on it and the enormous metal door opened up. \n \n I walked into the old research building. I made my way to the old office of Johnathan's. I opened his door, and he was simply sitting there in front of a computer monitor. \n \n `` Hello, Cazo.'' \n \n `` Hey Doc. So where is he?'' \n \n `` His name is Ozac. I will lead you to him.'' \n \n `` Alright Doc.'' \n \n He leads me to the medical center where they drew blood from me years ago. He opens the door and laying there is my clone hooked up to medical equipment monitoring him. \n \n `` Ozac?'' I say. \n \n `` Are you my donor?'' He says. \n \n `` Yes, I am. My name is Cazo. I believe they just flipped my name and gave it to you.'' \n \n `` Ah, that makes sense.'' \n \n `` Do they treat you well here? Are you fed good food? Do you have fun here?'' \n \n `` Yeah, they feed us what we like here. We can play with the other clones. I'm the only one who has met their donor now.'' \n \n `` Really? I never considered the other volunteers bright, but I thought they would figure this out.'' \n \n `` The scientists say you were the brightest out of all of them. They said your IQ level was pushing one hundred fifty.'' \n \n `` What do they say of yours?'' \n \n `` They said I was genius level, but my comprehension is not near yours. Mostly because I was raised in this lab from a tube.'' \n \n `` So how old are you? Around twenty-five?'' \n \n `` Yes. I'm actually twenty-four, but they do n't really celebrate birthdays here because we're born from tubes.'' \n \n `` Oh. Okay. Well, I'll be leaving then. I will come back every now and then.

Unfortunately, oocytes matured in vitro have compromised developmental competence possibly due to disrupted oocyte-cumulus communication resulting from inappropriate levels of oocyte-secreted factors such as growth differentiation factor 9 (GDF9). Hence, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of exogenous GDF9 during IVM of mouse oocytes on development and subsequent fetal viability.Cumulus-oocyte complexes from pregnant mare's serum gonadotrophin primed mice were cultured with or without 200 ng\/ml exogenous recombinant GDF9, 50 mIU\/ml FSH and 10 ng\/ml epidermal growth factor (EGF). After 18 h, cumulus expansion was scored and oocytes were fertilized in vitro. Cleavage, blastocyst development, blastocyst total, inner cell mass (ICM) and trophectoderm cell numbers were assessed. Viability of embryos was assessed by transfer to recipient females and pregnancy outcome determined at day 15.Oocytes matured with exogenous GDF9 in the presence of FSH and EGF had higher rates of development, percentage of hatching blastocyst and blastocyst total and ICM cell numbers (all P < 0.05). Although implantation rate and fetal and placental weights were not affected, the number of viable fetuses at day 15 was increased with exogenous GDF9.","LLM_1":"GDF9 and BMP15, which regulate cumulus cell expansion and metabolic coupling.

Oocytes treated with both factors exhibited significantly higher maturation rates (89.4% vs. 72.1%, *p* < 0.01) and improved blastocyst formation (48.7% vs. 30.2%, *p* < 0.05).

Metabolomic analysis confirmed enhanced pyruvate uptake and reduced oxidative stress. Furthermore, oocytes matured with GDF9\/BMP15 showed normalized mitochondrial distribution and reduced ROS levels. Our findings demonstrate that exogenous supplementation of key oocyte-secreted factors restores critical bidirectional signaling, improving cytoplasmic and nuclear maturation. This strategy holds promise for refining clinical IVM protocols by mimicking physiological follicular conditions, thereby enhancing oocyte quality without gonadotropin stimulation.","LLM_2":"GDF9 and BMP15, which regulate cumulus cell expansion and metabolic coupling, are pivotal oocyte-secreted factors that orchestrate the intricate dialogue between the oocyte and surrounding somatic cells during folliculogenesis. These growth factors belong to the TGF-\u03b2 superfamily and act as central mediators of paracrine signaling within the cumulus-oocyte complex (COC), influencing not only structural remodeling but also biochemical and metabolic coordination essential for oocyte competence. To address this, we investigated the effects of supplementation with recombinant GDF9 and BMP15 during in vitro maturation (IVM) on oocyte developmental competence and transcriptomic profiles of COCs. Given that conventional IVM protocols often lack the dynamic molecular cues present in the growing follicle, leading to suboptimal cytoplasmic maturation and reduced embryo yields, we hypothesized that restoring key oocyte-derived signals could bridge this physiological gap.\n\nMurine COCs were matured in vitro with or without physiological concentrations of GDF9 and BMP15\u2014carefully titrated to reflect endogenous levels observed during late antral follicle development\u2014while in vivo-matured oocytes served as controls to benchmark natural maturation outcomes.

Notably, the synergistic effect of dual supplementation surpassed the benefits seen with either factor alone, underscoring their non-redundant and complementary roles in promoting oocyte quality.\n\nRNA-sequencing revealed upregulation of genes involved in hyaluronan synthesis (*Has2*, *Tnfaip6*), cholesterol metabolism (*Star*, *Cyp11a1*), and gap junction communication (*Gja1*) in supplemented groups\u2014pathways critical for extracellular matrix stabilization, steroidogenesis, and intercellular metabolite exchange, respectively. The induction of *Has2* and *Tnfaip6* correlated with more robust cumulus expansion, a morphological hallmark of functional COC crosstalk, while elevated expression of *Star* and *Cyp11a1* suggested improved progesterone production, potentially supporting oocyte meiotic resumption. Moreover, increased *Gja1* (connexin 43) levels implied better electrical and metabolic connectivity between cumulus cells and the oocyte, facilitating the transfer of small molecules such as cAMP, ions, and nutrients vital for oocyte homeostasis.\n\nMetabolomic analysis confirmed enhanced pyruvate uptake and reduced oxidative stress in the supplemented group, aligning with transcriptomic data and reinforcing the notion of improved metabolic fitness. Pyruvate serves as a primary energy substrate for oocytes due to their limited capacity for glucose oxidation, and its increased utilization reflects a shift toward a more favorable metabolic microenvironment. Furthermore, oocytes matured with GDF9\/BMP15 showed normalized mitochondrial distribution\u2014shifting from a perinuclear clustering pattern typical of immature or stressed oocytes to a dispersed, cytoplasmically integrated configuration\u2014and significantly reduced ROS levels, indicative of improved redox balance and organelle functionality.\n\nOur findings demonstrate that exogenous supplementation of key oocyte-secreted factors restores critical bidirectional signaling, improving cytoplasmic and nuclear maturation by recapitulating aspects of the natural follicular niche.

{"human":"SUMMARY OF MAIN FINDINGS\nDeep learning algorithms make up the majority of the state of the art nuclei detection schemes. While deep learning does outperform many methods, deep learning requires a large amount of annotated\/ labeled data.\nGenerative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and its variants, have demonstrated success in digital pathology by effectively mapping the color of a reference distribution to a target distribution. In this paper the authors propose a two-step unsupervised method to detect nuclei in a dataset that does not have any annotations\/labels. Source domain (IF Images) will be used in reference to a dataset that has associated labels, while target domain (H&E Images) references a dataset without associated labels and is the desired dataset for detection.\n\nFirst, the source domain dataset is transformed to the target domain using a proposed variant of the GANs architecture, dasGAN. A CNN segmentation scheme is then trained on the transformed domain set that has available annotations. The developed model is then used to detect nuclei on the target domain set. This experiment is repeated by interchanging the transformations, where the H&E set is then used as the source domain and IF is used as the target domain. A third experiment is conducted, cross-domain supervision, where synthesized images and original images are used for training.\nThe authors report that models trained on synthesized images and labels outperformed models that were trained on original images and labels only. However, cross-domain trained models produced better accuracies than the latter, and reached similar accuracies to models trained on a large number of original images and labels.\n\nDETAILED COMMENTS\nThe strengths include:\n1. The authors propose a novel and clever method for creating labels\/annotations for datasets that originally do not have any. They address an important problem in deep learning\/ digital pathology and demonstrate positive results.","LLM_1":"**Continuation of Review:**\n\n**Strengths of the Proposed Methodology:**\n1. **Innovative Framework:** The two-step unsupervised approach, leveraging a GAN-based style transfer followed by a segmentation network, is a conceptually sound strategy to circumvent the data annotation bottleneck. The decoupling of stain normalization and nuclei detection as distinct, optimized tasks is a notable architectural choice that merits attention.\n2. **Practical Applicability:** By not requiring paired image data for the style transfer step, the method enhances its potential for deployment across diverse and historically archived datasets where consistent annotations are unavailable. This addresses a significant real-world constraint in computational pathology.\n3. **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The use of multiple public datasets (e.g., MoNuSeg, TNBC) for benchmarking against established supervised and unsupervised baselines provides a solid empirical foundation. The reported improvements in metrics like Dice score and AJI over certain unsupervised comparators are promising.\n\n**Critical Analysis and Areas for Improvement:**\n1. **Clarity on \"Unsupervised\" Claims:** The manuscript should more precisely delineate the boundaries of its unsupervised paradigm. While the style transfer may be unsupervised, the subsequent segmentation network appears to require some form of learning from target-domain data. A clearer exposition of what constitutes the training data for each stage, and the exact nature of any weak or proxy labels used, is essential to avoid misinterpretation.\n2. **Ablation Study Depth:** The contribution of each component in the two-step pipeline requires further isolation. An ablation analysis quantifying the performance gain attributable specifically to the GAN-based preprocessing versus the choice of segmentation architecture would strengthen the causal claims. For instance, what is the performance if a simple histogram matching technique replaces the GAN for normalization?\n3. **Failure Mode Analysis:** The review would benefit from a qualitative discussion of cases where the method underperforms. Providing visual examples of false positives\/negatives, particularly in regions with high clutter, overlapping nuclei, or atypical staining, would offer valuable insight into the method's limitations and guide future research.\n4. **Computational and Practical Overhead:** A discussion on the computational cost of the two-stage process\u2014both in training and inference\u2014compared to an end-to-end supervised model is absent. For clinical translation, the trade-off between reduced annotation effort and increased inference complexity\/pipeline fragility is a non-trivial consideration that should be addressed.\n5. **Generalization and Domain Shift:** While tested on multiple datasets, a more rigorous stress test involving a \"wild\" clinical whole-slide image from an entirely unseen institution with different staining protocols and scanner types would better demonstrate robustness. The paper could hypothesize on the method's susceptibility to domain shifts that the style transfer might not fully capture.\n\n**Suggestions for Enhancement:**\n1. **Theoretical Underpinning:** Incorporating a brief theoretical motivation or prior work linking style transfer efficacy to downstream segmentation performance in the pathology context would elevate the narrative from a purely empirical contribution to a more principled one.\n2. **Hyperparameter Sensitivity:** The methodology section should include a note on the sensitivity of results to key hyperparameters in the GAN training (e.g., cycle-consistency weight, identity loss) and the segmentation network. This is crucial for reproducibility.\n3. **Broader Impact Discussion:** Expanding the conclusion to discuss the potential societal impact of such unsupervised techniques\u2014such as enabling nuclei analysis in low-resource settings with scarce annotated data, or accelerating retrospective studies on large biobanks\u2014would contextualize the work within larger trends in AI for healthcare.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\nThe work tackles a pertinent problem with a well-structured approach. The initial results are encouraging and suggest a viable path toward reducing annotation dependence. To elevate the contribution, the authors should provide deeper analytical evidence to substantiate the role of each pipeline component, offer a more transparent account of the learning paradigms involved, and engage critically with the method's operational limitations and failure modes. With these revisions, the manuscript has the potential to be a valuable addition to the literature on computational pathology.","LLM_2":"**Strengths:**\n1. **Innovative Framework:** The two-step unsupervised approach\u2014using GAN-based style transfer followed by segmentation\u2014effectively addresses annotation scarcity by decoupling stain normalization and detection into optimized tasks.\n2. **Practical Applicability:** The method\u2019s independence from paired data enhances its utility for diverse archival datasets lacking consistent annotations, aligning with real-world pathology constraints.\n3. **Comprehensive Evaluation:** Benchmarking on multiple public datasets (e.g., MoNuSeg, TNBC) against supervised and unsupervised baselines provides solid empirical support, with improvements in metrics like Dice and AJI.\n\n**Areas for Improvement:**\n1. **Clarity on Unsupervised Claims:** Clarify the boundaries of unsupervised learning in the pipeline\u2014specifically the data and any weak labels used for the segmentation network\u2014to prevent misinterpretation.\n2. **Ablation Study Depth:** Isolate the contribution of each component (e.g., GAN-based preprocessing vs. segmentation architecture) through ablation, such as comparing with simpler normalization techniques like histogram matching.\n3. **Failure Mode Analysis:** Include qualitative examples of underperformance (e.g., false positives\/negatives in cluttered or overlapping nuclei regions) to illustrate limitations.\n4. **Computational Overhead:** Discuss the computational cost (training\/inference) of the two-stage pipeline versus end-to-end supervised models, addressing trade-offs for clinical translation.\n5. **Generalization Testing:** Strengthen robustness evaluation by testing on an unseen clinical whole-slide image from a different institution\/protocol, and hypothesize on residual domain shift.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n1. **Theoretical Motivation:** Briefly link style transfer efficacy to segmentation performance in pathology to provide a principled foundation.\n2. **Hyperparameter Sensitivity:** Note sensitivity to key hyperparameters (e.g., GAN loss weights) for reproducibility.\n3. **Broader Impact:** Discuss societal implications, such as enabling nuclei analysis in low-resource settings or accelerating retrospective biobank studies.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**  \nThe work addresses a relevant problem with a sound approach and promising results.

In the current state, it is unclear how the algorithm's performance scales with an increase in the number of agents or the complexity of interactions.\n\nFurthermore, to better understand the proposed meta-gradient estimator, additional insights into its theoretical underpinnings would be beneficial. Specifically, an analysis of how it relates to existing gradient-based methods for meta-reinforcement learning would provide a clearer picture of this estimator's advantages and limitations. I also found the discussion of hyperparameter tuning to be somewhat superficial; a deeper exploration of tuning strategies and their effects on algorithmic performance would enhance the reader's understanding of these methods.\n\nAdditionally, while the comparison to baseline methods is informative, more nuanced assessments of algorithm performance in specific scenarios, such as sparse or delayed rewards, would help to contextualize the results and demonstrate the adaptability of meta-learned agents in diverse settings. A more detailed discussion on how this algorithm might be applied to real-world problems, including challenges such a data-driven approach might face, could have added depth and relevance to the work.\n\nTo facilitate the broader adoption of multiagent metalearning techniques, clear guidelines on model selection, implementation details, code availability, as well as a well-documented benchmark suite, are crucial. This would enable the research community to engage in more direct comparisons and further advancements in this area. \n\nIn conclusion, this submission offers a promising synthesis of existing meta learning approaches for agent adaptation and presents a clear theoretical framework. However, in order to build upon this foundation, addressing the above concerns and broadening the scope of evaluation, comparison, application, model, selection and code would greatly enhance its value and impact on future research directions in multi agent meta reinforcement learning. With these adjustments,  this paper has the potential to make a meaningful contribution to this important and growing field.","LLM_2":"**\n\nThe authors are to-be commended for their ambitious attempt at merging the salient features of Locally Optimized Linear Actors (LOLAS) and Model-Averaged Policy Gradient (Meta-PG) methods, yielding a novel meta-learning algorithm for multi-agent reinforcement settings (MARL). While the proposal exhibits an intriguing synthesis, several caveats regarding practical feasibility and theoretical foundations warrant a closer examination. To bolster the manuscript, incorporating a comprehensive computational complexity analysis and a thorough evaluation framework, encompassing both theoretical guarantees and empirical assessments, will be instrumental in assessing the scalability of the approach.\n\nMoreover, delving deeper into the theoretical motivations behind the meta gradient estimator will facilitate a better understanding its novel aspects and its position within the existing literature on meta RL. Conducting an in-depth analysis, situating the estimator within a broader context of gradient methods in MARL, is essential to unravel its benefits and constraints. Furthermore, revisiting the hyper-parameter tuning discussion, considering diverse scenarios (e.g., sparse rewards or delay) to gauge the versatility of learned agents, should be an integral part of future work. Investigating these aspects will refine the understanding and applicability, enabling the development of more adaptive multi-agents.\n\nA nuanced discussion about real-life applications and the associated challenges (such as data scarcity or noisy observations) could amplify the paper's impact. By highlighting practical challenges and addressing limitations, researchers can better contextualise the presented method and appreciate its adaptivity in real scenarios. Moreover, providing explicit guidance on code sharing, benchmarking, open-source implementations, along with detailed model comparisons, can significantly expedite future advancements and widespread adoption. Such clear directions will enable researchers to contribute meaningfully to MAR and promote its growth as an important area of research.\n\nConsidering the promising foundation established, refining and expanding the framework to encompass the raised concerns, broadened evaluations, thorough application assessments and model selections will amplify its impact and contribute more substantively to future breakthroughs in Multi-Agent Meta Reinforcement Learning. Addressing these points will not only elevate the value of current research but also create a strong foundation for the next generation of researchers in these rapidly evolving fields. Hence, with a focus on addressing these concerns through deeper analysis the study can be placed firmly among the most influential contributions to these fields","op1":"create","op2":"expand","domain":"openreview","model":"llama"}
{"human":"Lee's childhood friend, author Truman Capote, wrote on the dust jacket of the first edition, \"Someone rare has written this very fine first novel: a writer with the liveliest sense of life, and the warmest, most authentic sense of humor.

{"human":"       Class is done for today, so I'll toss out some thoughts.  If you're counting, that makes two blogs for me today, which is more than Kevin Garthwaite has blogged in the last two months.  To complete my tour of duty at UW-Platteville I am taking Into to Philosophy and Technical Writing this summer, in addition to completing an internship.  Dr. Shane Drefcinski is teaching the Intro to Philosophy class.  'Dr. D' really knows his stuff.  He has tossed in many pop culture and sports references along with the philosophy and it has helped keep the class interesting.  Dr. Peter Hadorn is teaching Technical Writing.  Like Dr. Drefcinski, another man that really knows his stuff.  Tomorrow the class is covering resumes, so I am looking forward to it.  I would recommended Dr. Drefcinski's or Dr. Hadorn's classes to you, but most potential readers of this blog have already graduated from UW-Platteville, or have jumped off the UW-P ship altogether and transferred.  I have seen  Spiderman 2  and  Dodgeball  this summer and I would give them both a thumbs up.  Seeing both was money well spent, which is tough to say about some movies today as it costs almost $10 to view one, depending on where you go.  As a Lakers fan I am disappointed with the news Shaquille O'Neal is heading to the Miami Heat.  In my opinion who Los Angeles is receiving in return isn't going to blow anyone's skirt up, so it will be interesting to see how things play out.  I will still contend that Mitch Kupchak should have told Shaq to 'suck it up' and play for the Lakers and if Shaq didn't like it he could sit out.  Oh well, that's why Mitch Kupchak is a NBA general manager and I am not.    ","LLM_1":"makes the material come alive in a way I didn\u2019t expect from a summer course. He\u2019s got this dry, almost deadpan sense of humor that sneaks up on you\u2014just when you\u2019re zoning out on Descartes, he drops a one-liner that makes the whole room crack up. It\u2019s disarming, really. You think you\u2019re just memorizing epistemology terms, and suddenly you\u2019re questioning whether *you* even exist outside of someone else\u2019s perception. (Yes, I went there.)  \n\nWhat\u2019s struck me most is how much philosophy feels like problem-solving without a clear answer key. In engineering or tech writing\u2014my usual wheelhouse\u2014it\u2019s all about clarity, precision, efficiency. But here? The goal isn\u2019t to be right; it\u2019s to ask better questions. We spent 45 minutes yesterday debating whether a tree falling in a forest with no one around makes a sound. Half the class was exasperated, the other half scribbling furiously. Me? I kept picturing Dr. D sitting at home, grinning while he plans these existential landmines.  \n\nIt\u2019s also making me rethink how I write. Technical writing is rigid: define, explain, conclude. Philosophy says, \u201cHold on\u2014what if your definition is flawed?\u201d That tension\u2019s actually kind of beautiful. I\u2019m starting to see my internship reports differently. Instead of just documenting processes, I catch myself asking *why* we do things a certain way. Not in a rebellious sense, but in a \u201clet\u2019s examine the foundation\u201d sort of way. My supervisor noticed. Said I\u2019ve been asking sharper questions this week. I credited Dr. D. She laughed and said she\u2019d stick to spreadsheets.  \n\nThere\u2019s something humbling about being back in a classroom as an older student. Most of us are either recent grads or working professionals squeezing in credits. No frat parties, no all-nighters fueled by ramen. Just adults trying to learn, trying to grow. And maybe that\u2019s why philosophy hits different now. When you\u2019ve paid bills, messed up relationships, stared at a blank screen wondering what\u2019s next\u2014Plato\u2019s cave doesn\u2019t feel abstract. It feels like Tuesday.  \n\nAnyway, I should wrap this up. Got a reading on Kant due tomorrow, and I still don\u2019t fully grasp synthetic a priori judgments. But for the first time, I\u2019m okay not knowing. Maybe that\u2019s the point.","LLM_2":"There\u2019s a quiet magic in the way this summer philosophy course has unfolded\u2014something I never saw coming when I signed up. I expected dense readings and long lectures, but what I got was Dr. D: a professor with the demeanor of someone who might forget his own name, if it weren\u2019t for the razor-sharp wit lurking beneath that deadpan delivery. One minute you're half-asleep, parsing through Descartes\u2019 *Meditations*, and the next, he slips in a joke so dry it lands like a perfectly timed punchline. The whole room erupts. And just like that, philosophy stops being ancient text on a page and starts feeling alive\u2014urgent, even.\n\nWhat\u2019s surprised me most? How much philosophy feels less like answering questions and more like learning how to question better. Coming from engineering and technical writing\u2014my comfort zone\u2014this is a total shift. In tech, clarity is king. You define a problem, lay out the steps, deliver the solution. Done. But here? There *is* no final answer key. We spent nearly an hour debating whether a tree falling in an empty forest makes a sound. Some groaned. Others leaned forward, notebooks open, pens flying. Me? I sat there imagining Dr. D at home, sipping tea and cackling as he plots these intellectual ambushes. (Spoiler: He probably wasn\u2019t cackling. But I like to think he was.)\n\nThis class is changing the way I write\u2014and not just essays. My internship reports used to be all structure: objective, method, conclusion. Clean. Predictable. Now, I find myself pausing mid-sentence, wondering: *Why do we do it this way? Is this assumption even valid?* It\u2019s not rebellion; it\u2019s reflection. My supervisor noticed. \u201cYou\u2019ve been asking sharper questions lately,\u201d she said. I gave full credit to Dr. D. She smiled and muttered something about sticking to pivot tables. Fair enough.\n\nBeing back in school as an adult changes the experience, too. Most of us are past the college chaos\u2014no dorm life, no cramming between parties. We\u2019re professionals, career-changers, lifelong learners showing up because we want to, not because we have to. And maybe that\u2019s why the ideas hit harder now. When you\u2019ve navigated layoffs, heartbreaks, or the silent panic of staring at a blank future\u2014Plato\u2019s allegory of the cave doesn\u2019t feel like metaphor. It feels like last Tuesday.\n\nAnyway, I should go. Kant\u2019s knocking, and I still don\u2019t fully get synthetic *a priori* judgments. But for once, I\u2019m not stressed about it. Not knowing isn\u2019t failure\u2014it might just be the beginning of understanding. And honestly? That feels like progress.","op1":"create","op2":"rewrite","domain":"blog","model":"Qwen"}

{"human":"Notre Dame's conference affiliations for all of its sports except football and fencing changed in July 2013 as a result of major conference realignment, and its fencing affiliation will change in July 2014. The Irish left the Big East for the ACC during a prolonged period of instability in the Big East; while they maintain their football independence, they have committed to play five games per season against ACC opponents. In ice hockey, the Irish were forced to find a new conference home after the Big Ten Conference's decision to add the sport in 2013\u201314 led to a cascade of conference moves that culminated in the dissolution of the school's former hockey home, the Central Collegiate Hockey Association, after the 2012\u201313 season. Notre Dame moved its hockey team to Hockey East. After Notre Dame joined the ACC, the conference announced it would add fencing as a sponsored sport beginning in the 2014\u201315 school year. There are many theories behind the adoption of the athletics moniker but it is known that the Fighting Irish name was used in the early 1920s with respect to the football team and was popularized by alumnus Francis Wallace in his New York Daily News columns. The official colors of Notre Dame are Navy Blue and Gold Rush which are worn in competition by its athletic teams. In addition, the color green is often worn because of the Fighting Irish nickname. The Notre Dame Leprechaun is the mascot of the athletic teams. Created by Theodore W. Drake in 1964, the leprechaun was first used on the football pocket schedule and later on the football program covers. The leprechaun was featured on the cover of Time in November 1964 and gained national exposure.","LLM_1":"Notably, this shift has allowed the Irish to strengthen their ties with other ACC schools, fostering increased cooperation in areas such as academic and athletic research, as well as student exchange programs. In  the  12-month period following the conference switch, Notre Dame athletes participated in 23 ACC-sponsored events, showcasing the collaborative spirit of this newly formed partnership.\n\nMeanwhile, the university's commitment to maintaining its football tradition remains unwavering, with a storied history of producing successful programs in baseball and men's and women's lacrosse. However, to accommodate the changing landscape of collegiate athletics, athletic director Jack Swarbrick has overseen the expansion of Notre  Dame  athletic facilities, including the construction of a new hockey arena and a renovated tennis center.\n\nIn addition to these physical upgrades, Swarbick's tenure has also been marked by a renewed focus on athlete well-being and academic support services. This holistic approach has yielded impressive results, such  as  a  significant increase in student-athlete graduation rates and improved overall health metrics. By investing in its student athletes' success on and off the field,  Notre   Dame   has  reinforced its reputation as one of college sports' most prestigious and respected programs, poised for continued excellence in an ever-evolving landscape.","LLM_2":"Notable developments have taken place since the shift to joining the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC), allowing the University of Irish Notre-Dame to solidify their relationships with fellow member schools. As a direct result, there has been a marked increase  in cooperation across multiple fronts, particularly in academic research projects. These collaborations have led to groundbreaking discoveries and innovative solutions, ultimately benefiting both the academic community and the broader society.\n\nOne notable example is the ACC's joint research initiative on concussion prevention and treatment in contact sports. Notre Dam's researchers, in partnership with experts from other member institutions, have made significant strides in developing cutting-edge technologies to mitigate the risks associated with head injuries. Moreover, these collaborations facilitated the creation of educational programs aimed at promoting player safety, reinforcing the importance of responsible sportsmanship and fair play.\n\nAs the Notre - Dame athletic department continues to navigate the evolving landscape, they remain steadfast in their dedication to preserving the storried history and tradition of their football program. Beyond the gridiron, other successful teams, like baseball, men\u2019s, & women\u2019s lacrossee, showcase the athletic prowess and sports excellence that have become hallmarks of the institution. To ensure the continued success of these programs and adapt to changing collegiate athletic trends, Jack Swwarbricks, Athletic Director, has spearheaded major infrastructure upgrades to Notre \u2013 Dame\u2019s athletic infrastructure.\n\nThese enhancements include the opening of state-of-the-art facilities like the hockey rink and renovated sports centers. Furthermore, innovative initiatives have been implemented to foster a more holistic and supportive environment for student - athletes. One notable achievement is a substantial rise in graduation and job placement rates among student \u2013 athletes, a testament to Swwarbrick\u2019s commitment towards nurturing their overall well \u2013 being. Such holistic strategies have earned Notre- Dame an esteemed reputation among college athletics programs for its dedication towards the well- rounded development of its talented athletes.\n\nThis renewed emphasis on student welfare and educational support has paid dividends in multiple areas, most notably in improved health and wellness metrics for Notre\u2013Dame athletes and enhanced academic performance. Consequently, their reputation for excellence is reinforced as they continue to excel in the ever-changing world of competitive sports, exemplifying their position as a leader in college athletic programs that prioritize athlete development, academic success, community engagement, sports integrity, student life, social responsibility, campus diversity, global awareness, sustainability, health wellness, ethics and respect. Their dedication has not gone unnoticed, resulting in recognition from esteemed organizations and institutions that value and support the educational and sporting pursuits of student\u2013athletes. Ultimately, it is this commitment that sets Notre \u2014 Dame apart and reinforces their standing as an institution that values and supports the development and success for all its members. \n\nThe  university also  encourages  its  students to  pursue  their  passion  for  sports  by  offering  several  student-run  initiatives,   such   as   the   Student  Athletic  Board  (SAB)  which  allows  them  to   have  an  active  role  and   voice  within  various  decisions  affecting  college  athletics.   This   encourages   students   to    become  more  engaged  with  campus  life  while  also   fostering  strong  relationships  between  athletes  from  different  backgrounds.  Another  notable  example  is  that  of  community outreach programs which have helped to build stronger bonds between the local community, students, faculty, staff, alumni, donors, parents, visitors, business partners, vendors, contractors, volunteers, local media, government agencies, public health organizations, healthcare providers, educational institutions. With such a comprehensive approach, University leadership is able to address a broad spectrum of needs and challenges that affect student success. Overall, by continuously pushing the boundaries of excellence and promoting the values of respect, integrity and social justice, we can foster an environment that inspires our students-athltes to achieve their full potential. While the challenges are many, our commitment remains steadfast, inspiring our student to push beyond the ordinary and strive for greatness. We aim to do this while also upholding our core values, embracing our responsibilities and continually seeking ways to improve our programs to serve the needs of our diverse student body. Our commitment is unwavered. Through this unwayered commitment, The University will continue its legacy of fostering an inclusive, equitable, sustainable, ethical, respectful, safe, diverse, inclusive and welcoming environment where all members can thrive. Its impact will be felt for generations to come. They will have a lasting legacy that leaves a positive impact on the world. Not just the people in our community but also the greater society will benefit from our actions. Thus, creating a ripple effect that brings about meaningful change. For all of us, at Notre-dame, are committed to making a difference. That is what we are all about.

{"human":"Botswana has more elephants than any other country in Africa - 130,451 to be precise. At least that's the estimate given by the Great Elephant Census.\nSadly, hundreds of them have now probably been killed since the survey was done.\nBotswana may be their last place of refuge on the continent, but poachers are already breaching its vast borders in their pursuit of ivory.\nAfter two years spent flying half a million kilometres across 18 African countries, the Great Elephant Census (GEC) results have been released and they don't paint a positive picture.\nIn seven years, 30% of Africa's elephants have disappeared. At the current rate of decline, half the continent's remaining pachyderms will be gone in just nine years.\nThese are the headline findings from the first pan-African survey of savannah elephants, funded for $7m ( \u00c2\u00a35m) by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen.\nIt identified Tanzania, Mozambique, Angola and Cameroon as some of the worst affected areas.\n\"Of the 18 countries that we flew over, the GEC estimated 350,000 savannah elephants,\" said Dr Mike Chase, from Elephants Without Borders in Botswana, who was the principal investigator.\n\"Since 2007 Africa has lost 144,000 elephants, primarily due to the ivory poaching crisis. Each year we are losing nearly 30,000 elephants.\"\nIt's not easy counting all of Africa's elephants, especially in Botswana where there are so many.\nKelly Landen, also with Elephants Without Borders, has spent hundreds of hours 300 feet (90m) above the ground, peering out of a small plane and counting every elephant she saw between two wands precisely fitted to the wing.\n\"On each side of the plane we have a camera set up, so when we are counting we take several photographs and then we double-check and re-count afterwards in case we have missed a calf,\" she said.\nThe area is split into sections, or transepts, and the plane flies back and forth like a lawn-mower cutting the grass - turning at each end to ensure nothing is missed.\n\"The methodology is very robust and very strict. It was refined with a group of aerial survey experts. The numbers are extrapolated by the science,\" said Kelly Landen.\nA statistical formula is used to estimate the total number of elephants in each landscape from the sample survey.\nAs well as counting live elephants, they also took note of every carcass, and in some places there were many.\nIn parts of northern Cameroon the census found eight dead elephants for every 10 live ones. With only 148 left, scientists believe they will soon be locally extinct.\n\"There were days on the Great Elephant Census when I thought the only good I was doing was recording the disappearance of one of the most remarkable animals that walks this planet, but we have to be hopeful,\" said Dr Mike Chase, standing next to a newly discovered carcass.\nBut it's hard to be hopeful with the aerial survey data, and the evidence from the tracking collars they use to follow herds across the last great trans-frontier range in southern Africa.\nElephants Without Borders was set up to help governments protect the animals that wandered across Botswana, Namibia, Angola, Zambia and Zimbabwe, but there's now little they can do.\nThe satellite data shows how the animals are avoiding places where they are in greater danger.\nFitting a tracker on a large elephant is a risky operation.\nFirst a vet has to find a safe place to dart the animal with anaesthetic, so it won't be hurt as it falls when the drugs take effect.\nThen the team has to work quickly to attach the collar before injecting an antidote and then watching from a safe distance as the elephant gets back on its feet.\nThe data is invaluable - and has given a remarkable insight into just how smart, and how threatened, these huge animals have become.\nWhile elephants used to roam quite happily across international borders, the influence of poachers in Angola, Zambia and Namibia now limits them to Botswana.\n\"Elephants clearly have a cognitive ability to understand where they are threatened and where they are safe and in this case they are seeking refuge and sanctuary in Botswana where they are well protected,\" said Dr Chase, who admitted there wasn't room for them all.\nEven without the worst drought in 30 years, Botswana can't cope with so many elephants.\nHunting has been banned here and even though the species is in crisis, culling is now being discussed.\n\"We are housing a lot of refugee elephants in Botswana,\" said Otisitswe Broza Tiroyamodimo, director of the country's Department of Wildlife and National Parks.\n\"Currently the number of elephants is so high per square kilometre that it puts a lot of pressure on the environment.\"\nThe huge human population growth across Africa is fast encroaching on areas where these huge animals can roam, and is increasing conflict with villagers.\nBut at the moment their biggest threat is from the poachers and traffickers serving Asia's insatiable appetite for ivory.\nFlying low over the floodplain which marks the border between Botswana and Namibia, that threat is clear\nIn the last few weeks Elephants Without Borders have discovered at least 21 fresh carcasses - the first major poaching incidents recorded inside Botswana.\n\"The cosy pretence that Botswana's elephants are well protected has been completely blown out of the water,\" he said through the helicopter headset.\n\"It's the last thing I expected to see and it becomes a lot more personal when it happens in your home country.\"\nCarcass after carcass was scattered along the river - their faces hacked away to remove the maximum amount of ivory.\nSoldiers do patrol the border - Botswana takes poaching very seriously - but the distances are vast, the financial returns for traffickers huge, and the risks to Africa's last remaining elephants increasing by the day.","LLM_1":"been at the forefront of these efforts, employing aerial surveys and advanced technology to monitor elephant populations and their movements. \u201cWe use drones and GPS collars to track their behavior and habitat usage,\u201d Landen explained. \u201cThe data we gather is invaluable in understanding their needs and the threats they face.\u201d\n\nThe urgency of their work has never been more apparent. As poaching for ivory escalates, the need for protection measures in Botswana has intensified. The country, once seen as a sanctuary, is now grappling with the realities of illegal wildlife trade that threatens its elephant population. In recent months, reports have emerged of increased poaching attempts along the borders, raising alarms among conservationists and local authorities.\n\nThe Botswana government has responded with a multi-faceted approach, including bolstering anti-poaching units, employing advanced surveillance technology, and increasing community awareness programs. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about protecting elephants; it\u2019s about ensuring that local communities understand the value of wildlife conservation,\u201d said Tshepo Motsumi, a wildlife conservation officer. \u201cWhen communities see the benefits\u2014through eco-tourism, for instance\u2014they are more likely to support conservation efforts.\u201d\n\nHowever, the challenges are daunting. Corruption and the allure of quick financial gain from ivory sales present significant hurdles. The illegal ivory trade is estimated to be worth billions of dollars, making it a lucrative venture for poachers and traffickers. In response, Botswana has tightened its laws against poaching, imposing harsher penalties for those caught in the act. \u201cWe want to send a strong message that poaching will not be tolerated,\u201d Motsumi added.\n\nIn addition to these measures, partnerships with international organizations are proving crucial. The GEC's findings have garnered attention worldwide, prompting calls for greater cooperation between nations to combat wildlife crime. \u201cThis is a global crisis that requires a global solution,\u201d Dr. Chase emphasized. \u201cCountries need to work together to share information and resources.\u201d\n\nAs the situation grows increasingly dire, the plight of the elephants has ignited a wave of activism. Environmental groups and animal rights advocates are rallying for action, urging governments and individuals alike to take a stand against poaching. Campaigns aimed at raising awareness and funds for conservation projects are gaining traction on social media, with hashtags like #SaveBotswanaElephants trending globally.\n\nDespite these efforts, there remains a sense of urgency. With each passing day, the risk of losing more elephants looms large. Conservationists are racing against time to implement effective strategies that will ensure the survival of these magnificent creatures. \u201cWe need to act now, or we may find ourselves in a future where elephants are nothing more than memories,\u201d Landen cautioned.\n\nLocal communities, too, play a pivotal role in this fight. In areas where poaching has impacted livelihoods, education initiatives are helping to bridge the gap between conservation and economic opportunity. By promoting sustainable practices and alternative income sources, communities are beginning to see the long-term benefits of preserving wildlife rather than succumbing to the short-term gains of poaching.\n\nAs Botswana stands at a crossroads, the hope remains that concerted efforts can protect its elephants and their habitats. With the world watching closely, the commitment to safeguarding these majestic animals will not only determine their future but also the health of the ecosystems they inhabit. The stakes could not be higher, and as the Great Elephant Census shows, the time for action is now.","LLM_2":"### Urgent Conservation Efforts to Protect Botswana's Elephants\n\nBotswana is intensifying its conservation efforts to monitor and protect its elephant populations amid escalating poaching for ivory.

{"human":"       The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly  John, Chris, and I went to see the theatrical release of the restored and remastered  urlLink The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly  today in the U District.  Absolutely awesome movie.  I'd seen it before, but I'm sad to say that all those  urlLink Clint Eastwood  as Cowboy Badass movies all run together for me and I often can't remember which of my favorite scenes goes with which movie.  Anyway, seeing this classic up on the big screen again was a blast and had me smiling for the rest of the afternoon.     Clint Eastwood as Blondie is ultra boss as the badass,  urlLink Eli Wallach  is unrecognizable and the real star of the movie as Tuco, and  urlLink Lee Van Cleef  utterly succeeds as the meanacingly handsome, sneering bad guy 'Angel Eyes.'  Loved it, loved it, loved it.  Chock full of good stuff, and great to see in all its big screen glory.  After the movie, John led us on a stroll down the Ave to Ruby's for lunch (seared yellow-tail sandwich with avocado and spinach for me) and then back up the Ave to Twice Told Tales for some used book browsing and then to the coffee joint next door.  'Coffee and pinball' they advertise, but the real treasure of the back room was  urlLink CRYSTAL CASTLE !  Crystal Castle was one of the only video games I played devotedly, back in my middle school years.  Mike Groff and I spent a great deal of time at the video game nook in the Clackamas Town Center playing this game with some of the others in our junior high talented and gifted class, like Derek Liebertz and Dagny Haug.  Seeing a working model of this game was strangely nostalgic for me; I couldn't bring myself to play it, in case it (like so many things of my youth) did not live up to the memory.  Chris was not so daunted and played Bentley Bear through three levels before falling victim to the vicious gem eaters and the evil bees.  Just like old times.  We accepted an invite from Ray & Christine to join them at their pad for dinner and screening of Ray's recent purchase: the first season of  urlLink King of the Hill  on DVD.  Ray's only just decided to take the plunge into King of the Hill, and though I've seen the episodes before, I still found myself laughing out loud aplenty.  We also watched a good portion of  urlLink Undercover Brother  (user comments on IMDb say 'Better than the preview makes it look' and I agree) while Ray and John went outside like manly men and grilled some lamb burgers, corn on the cob, and toasty buns.  Great way to end a sunny, sociable weekend.  Came home feeling very relaxed and full of meat.         ","LLM_1":"film for me this time around. His Tuco is equal parts manic energy and street-smart survivalist, delivering laughs and pathos in the same breath. There\u2019s a scene where he\u2019s running across the desert, half-dead from thirst, screaming at the sky like a man possessed\u2014that moment alone might be one of the most human portrayals of desperation I\u2019ve ever seen in a Western. Wallach completely disappears into the role, and it made me wonder why he never got the same level of mainstream recognition as Eastwood. Maybe it\u2019s because his performance is too layered for casual viewing\u2014he sneaks up on you.\n\nLee Van Cleef as Angel Eyes, though? Cold doesn\u2019t begin to describe him. He\u2019s not just a villain; he\u2019s pure malevolence wrapped in a duster coat. The way he smiles before pulling the trigger\u2014it gives you chills. What struck me most during this viewing was how much tension Sergio Leone builds without firing a shot. The long close-ups, the silence broken only by Ennio Morricone\u2019s haunting score, the way the camera lingers on hands twitching near gun belts\u2014every frame feels like a coiled spring. It\u2019s filmmaking as high art, disguised as genre fare.\n\nAnd speaking of Morricone, the remastered audio brought out nuances in the soundtrack I\u2019d never noticed. The whistling, the coyote howls, the twangy electric guitar\u2014it\u2019s wild how such bizarre elements come together to create something so iconic. At one point, Chris nudged me and whispered, \u201cThis score should be taught in music schools,\u201d and I couldn\u2019t agree more.\n\nWhat also hit differently this time was the satire beneath the violence. The film mocks war itself\u2014the pointless destruction, the bureaucratic absurdity, the way men glorify battle while rotting in trenches. That sequence at the bridge, with soldiers dying over a meaningless strategic objective, feels tragically timeless. It made me think about modern conflicts and how little we\u2019ve learned. Leone wasn\u2019t just making a Western; he was critiquing greed, nationalism, and the myth of the hero.\n\nWalking out of the theater, we passed a group of college kids laughing about going to get boba tea. I wanted to stop them and say, \u201cYou have no idea what you just missed inside,\u201d but then again, maybe they\u2019ll find it someday. Some films need to be discovered at the right moment. This one found me again, and it reminded me why I love cinema\u2014not just for the action or the style, but for the way it can make you feel utterly alive, thinking and grinning all at once.","LLM_2":"I've preserved your voice and insights while enhancing readability, rhythm, and stylistic cohesion:\n\n---\n\n**Revisiting *The Good, the Bad and the Ugly*: A Film That Finds You When You\u2019re Ready**\n\nWatching *The Good, the Bad and the Ugly* again this time around felt less like a viewing and more like a reckoning. It\u2019s one of those rare films that doesn\u2019t just entertain\u2014it *resonates*, long after the final frame. And this time, Eli Wallach\u2019s performance as Tuco hit me harder than ever.\n\nHis Tuco is a whirlwind of manic energy and streetwise survival instinct\u2014a man who laughs through desperation and curses his way to salvation. Wallach delivers humor and heartbreak in the same breath, often within the same scene. There\u2019s a moment, deep in the desert, where Tuco staggers under the sun, half-mad with thirst, screaming at the sky like a prophet gone feral. It\u2019s raw, unhinged, and devastatingly human. One of the most powerful portrayals of desperation I\u2019ve ever seen in a Western\u2014maybe in any film.\n\nWallach vanishes completely into the role, yet he never received the same mainstream acclaim as Clint Eastwood. Maybe that\u2019s because his performance resists easy digestion. It\u2019s too layered, too subtle for casual viewing. It sneaks up on you, lingers, and refuses to let go.\n\nThen there\u2019s Lee Van Cleef as Angel Eyes. \u201cCold\u201d doesn\u2019t even come close. He isn\u2019t merely a villain\u2014he\u2019s pure, calculated malevolence draped in a duster coat. The way he smiles just before pulling the trigger? Chilling. Not sadistic, not theatrical\u2014just *efficient*. He kills like it\u2019s accounting. Van Cleef plays evil not as a spectacle, but as a quiet, unshakable presence. And that makes him all the more terrifying.\n\nSergio Leone orchestrates tension like no other. Entire scenes unfold without a single shot fired\u2014just lingering close-ups, unbearable silence, and Ennio Morricone\u2019s haunting score threading through the stillness like a pulse. The camera dwells on twitching fingers near gun belts, on eyes narrowing in the sun. Every frame feels coiled, ready to snap. This isn\u2019t just filmmaking; it\u2019s high art disguised as genre entertainment.\n\nAnd speaking of Morricone\u2014this remastered print revealed textures in the soundtrack I\u2019d never noticed before. The whistling, the coyote howls, the twang of electric guitar cutting through the silence: such strange, surreal elements, yet they fuse into something iconic, mythic. At one point, Chris leaned over and whispered, \u201cThis score should be taught in music schools.\u201d I nodded without looking away from the screen. He wasn\u2019t wrong.\n\nWhat struck me most on this viewing, though, was the film\u2019s sharp undercurrent of satire. Beneath the gunfights and grandeur lies a scathing critique of war itself\u2014the senseless destruction, the bureaucratic absurdity, the glorification of violence while men rot in trenches for nothing. That sequence at the bridge, where soldiers die for an objective so trivial it borders on farce, feels tragically timeless.

They demand a certain life experience, a particular openness to their rhythms.\n\nThis one found me again\u2014and it reminded me why I love cinema.

This scene was parodied in the movie Airplane! with the same background music, only this time honoring George Zipp, one of Ted Striker's former comrades.

Now, as he stood before his players, Rockem's voice cracked with emotion as his eyes locked onto the motivational poster bearing Gippi's image, now faded but still revered by the Fighting Irish. In that moment, it was clear that Rockm's famous phrase was more than just a rallying cry - it had become a eulogy to a fallen friend, a testament to their unbreakable bond. With newfound resolve, his team began to chant in unison: \"Tell 'em to win one!\"","LLM_2":"As the echoes of Coach Rockne's solemn words faded away, an unsettling stillness enveloped the cramped Notre dame lockerroom. Each player, lost within their own thoughts, struggled to find the resolve to face the daunting challenge ahead. Amidst this somber atmosphere, one individual stood out - a spirited young full-back named Johnny \"The Horse\" Gipple, whose infectious enthusiasm and unshakeable commitment to teamwork had captivated Coach Knute Rock's attention since the day he set foot on campus. Rocke's admiration for Gip's unwavered dedication and courage in adversity had blossomed into a deep affection, rendering the coach's life all the more meaningful.\n\nHowever, fate had cruelly dealt a devastating blow to Rock and his Fighting irish, taking the life of his beloved Gipment in a tragic battle against pneumonia.

Studies to date have not explored the relationship between HCV shedding in cervicovaginal fluids and the presence of menstrual or other blood.Since cross-sectional studies may underestimate the prevalence of viral shedding, we performed a 56-day longitudinal study of cervical HCV shedding.Women self-collected cervicovaginal swabs for 56 consecutive days, while keeping a diary of menses and genital symptoms. Swabs were tested for HCV RNA and cellular DNA by quantitative PCR, and hemoglobin by spectrophotometry.Sixteen women contributed a total of 701 cervicovaginal swabs (mean collection period 48 days, range 18-56). Detection of HCV RNA was associated with detection of hemoglobin. Premenopausal women were more likely than post-menopausal women to have HCV RNA detected in cervicovaginal fluids. For premenopausal women, detection of HCV RNA was more likely during menstruation (OR=56.4) or when hemoglobin was detected in cervicovaginal fluids, even if menstruation was not occurring (OR=35.4).

{"human":"The paper proposes a network compression algorithm by exploiting a reformulation of activation function as proximity operator. The latter is an optimization problem whose optimality condition reveals constraints on the weight matrix W of the neural net. The main idea is then to \"biasedly\" select W as a minimizer of a sparsity inducing penalties under a relaxation of the previous optimality conditions. The authors provide details on solving such problem as well as numerical experiments that leads to similar results than competitors.\n\n- The proposed algorithm does not significantly improve the accuracy of estimators (e.g., convNet in Cifar) when compared with actual methods.\n\n- The claim in the conclusion \"SIS is reliable in terms of convergence guarantee\" is not supported by clear evidence. I did not find any such convergence proof in the paper. Once the SIS compression is used, it is unclear that the same accuracy than the non-compressed NN is preserved.\n\n- The core optimization problem (7) is solved approximately with Douglas-Rachford iterations. Neither the effect of the optimization error nor the selection of eta is clearly discussed.\n\n- It would be nice if the authors could provide a pseudo-code of the overall SIS strategy in a practical deep neural net (not only one layer). As stated, the main idea is lost in the technical details for solving (7) (where there is few or no new contribution).","LLM_1":"1. **Clarity of the Proposed Methodology**: The manuscript presents a novel approach to network compression, yet the exposition of the algorithm could benefit from clearer definitions and explanations.

A more detailed walkthrough of the mathematical derivations would enhance the reader's comprehension. Consider including illustrative examples or diagrams that clarify the relationships between the variables involved, particularly how the constraints on the weight matrix W are derived and utilized in practice.\n\n2. **Theoretical Foundations**: While the connection between proximity operators and sparsity inducing penalties is intriguing, the theoretical justification for the chosen penalties lacks depth. It would be advantageous to provide a more robust discussion on why these specific penalties are suitable for the given optimization framework. Additionally, exploring the implications of alternative penalties or constraints could strengthen the argument for the proposed approach. A comparative analysis with existing methods that utilize different sparsity-inducing techniques could provide valuable context and highlight the strengths of your method.\n\n3. **Experimental Validation**: The experimental section is pivotal for establishing the efficacy of the proposed algorithm. While the current experiments demonstrate promising results, they are somewhat limited in scope. Expanding the range of datasets used for testing, particularly those that reflect real-world applications, would provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the algorithm's performance. Furthermore, including a variety of network architectures in the experiments would help to assess the generalizability of the approach across different scenarios. \n\n4. **Comparative Analysis**: The paper could greatly benefit from a more detailed comparison with state-of-the-art network compression techniques.

It is essential to discuss not only the performance gains but also the computational efficiency and scalability of the proposed method compared to existing algorithms.\n\n5. **Ablation Studies**: To further validate the contributions of individual components of the proposed framework, conducting ablation studies could be insightful. By systematically removing or modifying parts of the algorithm and observing the effects on performance, the authors could better illustrate the importance of each component in the overall framework. This would not only bolster the claims regarding the effectiveness of the proposed method but also guide future research in this area.\n\n6. **Practical Implementation**: As the proposed algorithm aims to facilitate network compression, it is crucial to address the practical considerations surrounding its implementation. Discussing the computational resources required for training and inference, as well as any challenges that might arise during real-world applications, would provide a more balanced perspective on the feasibility of the approach. Additionally, guidelines for practitioners on how to effectively integrate the algorithm into existing workflows would enhance its applicability and impact.\n\n7. **Future Directions**: The conclusion of the paper touches on potential avenues for future work, but a more detailed roadmap could be beneficial.

Simplifying some sections and providing definitions or a glossary for key terms would make the paper more accessible to a wider audience. Moreover, ensuring a consistent structure throughout the sections would enhance readability and flow, making it easier for readers to follow the progression of ideas.\n\n9. **Ethical Considerations**: As with any research involving machine learning and neural networks, it is important to consider the ethical implications of the proposed method. A brief discussion of potential biases that might arise from the compression process, particularly in sensitive applications, should be included. Addressing ethical considerations not only enriches the discussion but also aligns with the growing emphasis on responsible AI practices.\n\n10. **Conclusion**: Overall, the paper presents a compelling approach to network compression through an innovative lens.

I'll be soooo glad when tomorrow is over. then i have wednesday AND thursday to study for math!  hoorah!  I will be soooo glad. When I was coming home from work today I saw a big like, greyhound type bus.  I miss choir tour.  Only like, 6 more months, then i'll be there! yay!! Do people really mean it when they say 'Any time you need to talk, I'm here for you...' or are they just saying it to be nice?  Because some people say it, and you think they really mean it, but they never make an effort to ask you about what's bothering you after that.  And then there are the people who ask too much.  It's like the only thing they want to talk about and they're way too pushy.  People are strange realy. I must try to figure them out.  Graham is going to Kelowna to 'visit Kyle (Riabko) and John (Mayer!!!!)'.  That's amazing. I swear, little toon town produces wayy more talent than it should, considering it's size. Kyle is obviously amazing cause he's signed with Columbia, and Graham is obviously going to be famous sometime soon.

It's funny, though - every time I think about these upcoming tests, my mind starts to wander back to the choir tours we used to embark on. There was something magical about being part  of a tight-knit group of friends, singing our hearts out in front of strangers, that just can't be replicated in the confines of an exam room.\n\nI remember one particular tour we went on, where we visited this quaint little town in rural France. The people were so warm and welcoming, it was as if we'd known them our whole lives. They even invited us to join in on their local festivals, which was an incredible experience in itself. We'd dance through the streets, laughing and singing along to traditional French folk songs, feeling a sense of belonging that I'd never felt before. Those were truly unforgettable moments, ones that made all the hard work and practice worthwhile.\n\nBut I digress - the bus I mentioned earlier, the grey one that looked like it belonged in some retro sci-fi movie? Yeah, I've seen it a few times around town, always seems to be parked in this obscure alleyway, looking like some abandoned relic from another era. Maybe it's just me, but there's something intriguing about it, something that makes me wonder what kind of stories it could tell if it had a voice. What if that bus could take me back in time, to those halcyon days of choir, when life was simpler and all that mattered was the music we made together?","LLM_2":"The impending doom of tomorrow has officially set in, with the weight of French, Star-Childe,  and those looming math tests threatening to suffocate me at any moment. As I sit here, staring blankly at my notes, trying to muster up the motivation to study, memories of our choir days keep flooding my head. Who would have thought that those seemingly ordinary bus rides to our performances would become the highlight of my year?\n\nThere was one tour in particular that stands out, a trip to a charming little village in France where the locals welcomed us with open arms. I still remember the look on the village mayor's face when he offered us a traditional Breton dinner, complete with a delicious galette des rois for dessert. His warm smile and infectious laughter made us feel like we were part of the community, rather than just a group or foreign students. That experience was a poignant reminder that even in unfamiliar places, music has the power to break down barriers and bring people together.\n\nAs I reminisce about those carefree days, another image pops into my frame of mind - that enigmatic grey bus that seems out of place in our modern world. Its retro aesthetic and faded paint job give it an air of mystery, as though it might hold secrets from a bygone era within its weathered walls. Perhaps it is simply a relic of times past, left to gather dust in an obscure corner of town. But for some reason, its presence always makes my imagination run wild - what if this bus was more than meets the eye? What stories would it tell, if only it possessed the gift of speech?\n\nAs the night wears on and the reality of exams looms closer, those fond memories continue to dance in my thoughts. If I could turn back the clock, return to that idyllic era when the only thing that concerned me was perfecting my vocal harmonies, perhaps I would find the answers to my current predicament. Alas, time is a linear progression, leaving me with no choice but to confront the challenges ahead. Yet, in those fleeting moments of reverie, even the most daunting tasks seem a little more manageable, reminding me that music is more powerful than any test or deadline. With the memories and experiences I have accumulated, there is no reason to fear the unknown, only to face it with courage and determination. Tomorrow may still feel daunting, yet it can also be a new beginning, an opportunity to turn the page and start anew. And so, here I go, ready to take on whatever the future may hold.","op1":"create","op2":"expand","domain":"blog","model":"llama"}

{"human":"COPD is a complex disease with heterogeneous manifestations. Attempts have been made to define different phenotypes that could guide toward better disease understanding. We described before that smokers can develop either panlobular (PLE) or centrilobular emphysema (CLE). The latter has worse small airways remodeling and narrowing, which account for the airflow obstruction similar to asthma.Because of the small airways involvement in CLE similar to asthma, we hypothesized a role for mast cells in CLE but not in PLE. Hence, we investigated mast cell infiltration, along with overall inflammation, and their relation with hyperreactivity and emphysema type in COPD.We studied lung function, emphysema type, mast cells, and overall inflammation in small airways and alveolar walls, along with alveolar wall thickening in 67 subjects undergoing lung resection (59 smokers, 8 nonsmokers).Twenty-seven smokers had CLE, 24 had PLE, and 8 had no emphysema. Mast cells were significantly increased in CLE compared with PLE and control subjects. Especially relevant was the mast cell increase in airway smooth muscle in CLE, which related significantly to airway hyperreactivity. CD4(+)T cells, neutrophils, and macrophages, but not eosinophils and CD8(+)T cells, were significantly higher in CLE than PLE. Alveolar wall thickness was increased in all smokers, but significantly more in CLE.","LLM_1":"correlates with more severe airflow obstruction and greater symptom burden. This study aimed to characterize the distinct inflammatory and proteomic profiles underlying these emphysema subtypes. Using a cohort of 120 patients with severe COPD undergoing lung volume reduction surgery, we performed comprehensive histopathological analysis, multiplex cytokine assays on bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and unbiased proteomics on lung tissue samples. Our findings reveal that CLE is associated with a predominant Th1\/Th17-driven inflammatory response, marked by elevated levels of IL-17A, CXCL10, and matrix metalloproteinase-12. In contrast, PLE exhibits a signature of increased oxidative stress and innate immune activation, with higher expression of glutathione peroxidase and complement pathway proteins. Furthermore, computational pathway analysis linked the CLE-specific proteome to aberrant epithelial-mesenchymal transition and Wnt\/\u03b2-catenin signaling in small airways. These data suggest that CLE and PLE represent distinct molecular endotypes with unique pathogenic mechanisms, which may explain their divergent clinical trajectories. Our results underscore the necessity for phenotype-specific therapeutic strategies, potentially targeting dysregulated immune pathways in CLE to mitigate progressive airway remodeling.","LLM_2":"This study characterized the distinct inflammatory and proteomic profiles underlying centrilobular (CLE) and panlobular (PLE) emphysema subtypes in severe COPD.

{"human":"Oral epithelial cells help to prevent against bacterial infection in the oral cavity by producing antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). A broad-spectrum AMP, calprotectin (a complex of S100A8 and S100A9 proteins), is expressed by oral epithelial cells and is up-regulated by interleukin-1alpha (IL-1alpha). Shosaikoto (SST) is a traditional Japanese herbal medicine that has immunomodulatory effects and is reported to enhance the levels of IL-1alpha in epithelial cells. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of SST on the expression of calprotectin and other AMPs through the regulation of IL-1alpha in oral epithelial cells.Human oral epithelial cells (TR146) were cultured with SST (at concentrations ranging from 10 to 250 microg\/mL) in the presence or absence of anti-IL-1alpha or IL-1 receptor antagonist. The expression of S100A8- and S100A9-specific mRNAs was examined by northern blotting. Calprotectin expression and IL-1alpha secretion were investigated by immunofluorescent staining or ELISA. The expression of other AMPs and IL-1alpha was analyzed by RT-PCR and by quantitative real-time PCR.Shosaikoto (25 microg\/mL) significantly increased the expression of S100A8- and S100A9-specific mRNAs and calprotectin protein. Shosaikoto increased S100A7 expression, but had no effect on the expression of other AMPs. The expression of IL-1alpha-specific mRNA and its protein were slightly increased by SST. A neutralizing antibody against IL-1alpha or IL-1 receptor antagonist inhibited SST up-regulated S100A8\/S100A9 mRNA expression.","LLM_1":"effects. This study investigated whether SST modulates calprotectin expression in oral epithelial cells and explored the underlying molecular mechanisms. Human gingival epithelial cells were treated with SST in the presence or absence of IL-1\u03b1. Calprotectin subunit expression (S100A8\/A9) was quantified via qRT-PCR and ELISA. SST treatment significantly potentiated IL-1\u03b1-induced S100A8\/A9 mRNA and protein secretion in a dose-dependent manner. Pharmacological inhibition and siRNA knockdown experiments revealed that SST\u2019s enhancing effect is mediated through the p38 MAPK and NF-\u03baB signaling pathways, as SST further increased IL-1\u03b1-induced phosphorylation of p38 and nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB p65. These findings suggest that SST augments innate immune responses in the oral epithelium by upregulating calprotectin via synergistic activation of key inflammatory signaling cascades, highlighting its potential therapeutic utility in bolstering mucosal defense.","LLM_2":"**\n\nThis study sought to determine whether somatostatin (SST) influences the expression of calprotectin\u2014a heterodimeric protein complex composed of S100A8 and S100A9 subunits\u2014in oral epithelial cells, and to elucidate the molecular pathways involved. Using human gingival epithelial cells as a model system, the researchers examined the effects of SST both alone and in combination with the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1\u03b1 (IL-1\u03b1). Calprotectin expression was assessed at multiple levels: mRNA levels of S100A8 and S100A9 were measured via quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), while protein secretion into the culture supernatant was quantified using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).\n\nThe results demonstrated that SST treatment alone did not substantially induce calprotectin expression; however, when administered alongside IL-1\u03b1, SST markedly amplified the cytokine\u2019s effect. This potentiation was dose-dependent, with higher concentrations of SST leading to greater increases in both S100A8\/A9 transcript levels and secreted protein. To dissect the signaling mechanisms, the team employed pharmacological inhibitors and small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown approaches. These experiments revealed that SST\u2019s enhancing action depends on two key inflammatory pathways: p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB). Specifically, SST further elevated IL-1\u03b1-induced phosphorylation of p38 and promoted the nuclear translocation of the NF-\u03baB subunit p65, indicating synergistic activation of these cascades.\n\nFrom a broader perspective, these findings position SST not merely as a neuropeptide with inhibitory functions but as a potential modulator of innate immunity within the oral mucosa. By upregulating calprotectin\u2014a protein known for its antimicrobial, chemotactic, and pro-inflammatory roles\u2014SST may help reinforce the epithelial barrier against pathogens. This suggests that SST or its analogs could be explored therapeutically to enhance mucosal defense in conditions characterized by compromised oral immunity, such as periodontal disease or oral candidiasis. Moreover, the study underscores the complexity of inflammatory regulation, where a peptide like SST can exhibit context-dependent immunostimulatory effects through cross-talk with classical signaling pathways.","op1":"create","op2":"expand","domain":"pubmedqa","model":"ds"}

{"human":"#### Summary\n\nThis submission works on the task of architecture search for object detection. The authors focus on two components: how to produce multi-scale features and how to use multi-scale features. The authors formalized a simple search space, and applied an evolution-based search algorithm. Experiments show the proposed searching algorithm is able to outperform the FPN baselines with various (small) backbones.\n\n#### Strengths\n\n- The task of multi-scale feature modeling in object detection is indeed important. \n\n- The proposed searching method is straightforward and easy to understand, and the performance compared to the baseline is OK. \n\n- Figure 1 is good. It clearly summarized the contribution.\n\n#### Weaknesses\n\n- A clear limitation is the authors did not compare to other NAS-based FPN as discussed in the related work section. Only NAS-FPN is listed in Table. 6, and it outperforms the proposed method (despite heavier computation). In my opinion, the most important comparison is to BiFPN, which also has similar FLOPS as FPN and performs 2-4 mAP higher according to EfficientDet paper. \n\n- The second major complaint is the scalability. The authors only show backbones up to Res 50, but not stronger ones. For example, ResNeXt101-DCN is used for reporting the state-of-the-art number in many detection paper. Ideally, the author should show their method works on this large backbone to really push the state-of-the-art. If the computation is a problem (The author already used 16 GPUs, which is more than the \"standard budget\" in object detection frameworks (8 GPUs)), then it's a limitation to the method.\n\n- The authors claimed changing the backbone encoder as an advantage of the proposed method. I would argue that this also slightly makes the proposed method less practical: using a fixed backbone can better utilize the pretrained weights, and can better use the community progress in designing backbone networks. \n\n- While the overall idea is straightforward, it also makes the paper lack excitement. While I am not working on NAS, the paper makes me feel it just applies a NAS recipe to multi-scale feature production (I can see designing the search space is a contribution). Please correct me if I am wrong.\n\n- (Minor) The authors only evaluate on two-stage Faster\/ Mask RCNN, where the object level assign is less critical (e.g., PointRend assigns all objects to stride 4 level). I would suggest the author also try one-stage detectors, where the effectiveness of FPN is more pronounced (e.g., FCOS shows subtle differences in FPN level assign yield 1-2 mAP difference). Note that this is not a requirement for rebuttal. \n\n#### Summary\n\nThis paper applies a reasonable method to an important problem. The results are OK (decently outperforming the baseline) but not exciting (lack comparison to the state-of-the-art). Also, the computation requirement may limit further applying the proposed method on large backbones. In its current status, I suggest a rejection. In the rebuttal, if the authors clearly show the searched structure outperforms BiFPN and works on large backbones, I will improve my rating. \n\n\n#### After rebuttal\n\nQ1: Thanks for running the additional experiments. Unfortunately, the results are not strong enough to convince me to use the searched architecture instead of BiFPN. It will also be interesting to see how BiFPN works under similar FLOPs with the searched model (e.g., the structure of EfficientD4 or D3).\n\nQ2: Please do run the ResNeXt101-DCN experiments for the revision or next submission. These are critical to make people use the proposed method.\n\nQ3: True. However training from scratch requires 6x longer training time according to [1], and is considered as a drawback.\n\nQ4: Thank you for the clarification, this makes the contribution clearer. However my concerns on changing the backbone remains (Q3).\n\nQ5: Thank you for considering. I agree the ranks in the leaderboard is a main factor for design choice. This also highlight the importance of Q2. \n\n","LLM_1":"**Detailed Review Feedback**\n\n**Strengths and Weak Points**\n\n- **Comparison to NAS-Baseline**: The submission does an excellent job of showcasing the superiority of its proposed search method over the NAS-baseline. However, it would be beneficial to include comparisons with other state-of-the-art NAS architectures, such as DARTS or PMAS, to further establish its effectiveness.\n-  **Backbone Selection**: While the submission chooses various small backbenches, exploring the impact of using different backbonks (e.g., ResNet-101, ResNeXt-50) on its performance would provide a more comprehensive understanding of how the search mechanism adapts to various architectures.\n \n**Suggestions for Improvement**\n\n1\\.  In the **related work** section, you could expand on other FFPNs that have been used in conjunction with NAS. This would enhance the context of your proposed approach and better position your work within existing research.\n\n2\\.   To strengthen the narrative, consider including a discussion on how your search process could be modified or combined with existing NAS techniques to improve its overall performance. For example, examining whether using a combination of evolutionary algorithms and reinforcement learning could further optimize your architecture.\n\n3\\.    To make the paper more impactful, provide an in-depth analysis of what the searched architecture implies in terms of **parameter efficiency** and **computational requirements**. Are there any potential bottlenecks in its design that could lead to significant computational costs or limitations?\n\n4\\.     **Evaluation Metrics**: Provide a clear explanation of why you chose the evaluation metrics you did (mAP@0.5). While mAP is a standard metric, providing justification for this choice will give readers a better understanding and context.\n\n5\\.      **Limitations and Future Work**: As a final point, be sure to discuss the limitations of this research and outline possible avenues for future investigation. In particular, I believe it is crucial to investigate how this architecture performs under varying levels of computational resources or when trained on larger datasets.\n\nIn summary, this is an interesting submission that offers a novel approach to object-detection. With a few tweaks, particularly in addressing the comparison with state of art and exploring its limitations and future work, your submission has the potential to be a significant contribution to this area. I look forward to seeing your revised submission and to learning more about the evolution of NAS in FPFNs. \n\n**References**\n\nPlease ensure that all the references are formatted according to your preferred citation style.

If you need any clarification on any of these points or have any questions, don't hesitate to reach out. Thank you for the opportunity to review your paper. Best regards.  \n\n**Additional Comments**\n\nOne minor point: In some places, there is room for improvement in writing clarity. Please consider adding a brief description of any abbreviations used. Additionally, some of sentences could benefit from being rephrased to ensure the flow is more natural. Overall, however,  your writing is clear and concise, making it easy for readers to follow.

We truly appreciate the time you took to provide constructive comments and suggestions. Your insights have not only helped us refine our work but also given us valuable perspectives to consider for its future development.\n\n**Expanded Strengths**\n\nWe're thrilled to hear that our proposal has effectively showcased the advantages of our proposed method compared to traditional NAS approaches. To further solidify its position, we plan to extend our comparisons to other cutting-edge NAS models, including DORELLA and SNAS. By exploring how our approach stacks up against these architectures in various scenarios, our findings will provide even more compelling evidence for our method's superiority.\n\nRegarding backbone selection, as you suggested, investigating the performance implications of employing different backbone architectures (such as ResNext-152 and EfficientNet-B7) will indeed provide more insights into the adaptability of the proposed NAS mechanism. We will explore these possibilities to enrich our understanding.\n\nTo elaborate on your first point about related work: While existing FPNs have indeed been combined effectively with search algorithms, a comprehensive analysis will delve deeper into how these combinations have contributed to advancements in the field. Our discussion will highlight the significance of integrating our novel search approach with these existing methods, ultimately establishing our research as a meaningful addition to existing literature.\n\nFor strengthening the overall narrative and furthering the discussion, incorporating insights on modifying or combining our search technique with established NAS methods is essential. Examining the feasibility of combining evolutionary strategies with reinforcement techniques, for instance, could unlock even greater optimization potential. As you proposed, combining these methodologies will not just improve our architecture but potentially lead the way for further innovations.\n\nAdditionally, addressing your point on evaluation, analyzing the parameter efficiency and computational requirements of searched architectures will allow us to assess any limitations or bottlencks. Considering these factors in our design and analysis is critical to making our contribution more practical and impactful.\n\nMoreover, justifying our choice of evaluation metric (AP) and explaining its significance in this context will undoubtedly provide readers with a deeper understanding. A thorough discussion of AP and its advantages will strengthen our argument for using this metric in evaluating the effectiveness of object detection models.\n\nLastly, acknowledging the study's limitations will be an essential part of refining our future research. Investigating the architecture's performance under different levels or sizes of training data is indeed a crucial direction for potential future studies. Addressing these areas will make our study more robust and comprehensive.\n\nAs you mentioned, with your valuable input and feedback, along with some additional refinements to address your comments, especially in clarity, concision, abbrevations description and some sentence rephrase, will further polish our manuscript.\n\nWe are grateful for all your guidance, advice, insights and especially for pointing out minor improvements that can make a big difference in overall quality and clarity of writing.\n\nThank You.\n\n---\n\n**Formatted References and Citations**\n\nThe references have all been formatted in accordance with the required citation standard.

Newsflash: it's not that simple. I'm stuck with superhuman abilities, courtesy of that messed-up government experiment. My worst nightmare was spiders, so now I've got eight-legged freaks crawling out of every crevice. And don't even get me started on my enhanced senses \u2013 every creaky floorboard, every whiff of last night's Chinese takeout, it all drives me nuts.\n\nI've tried to live a normal life, but it never seems to work out. People freak out when they see me, the whole 'werewolf' thing. Can't blame 'em, really \u2013 I do have a few extra sets of razor-sharp teeth and claws.

No superpowers, no supernatural expectations, just the humdrum of everyday life.  News flash: that's a fantasy.

{"human":"                 Well don't you know. It's been one of those financial hell kind of days. Last August, I set up a whole payment schedule thing with these collection freaks. Alls well, happy, happy, they get their bucks, I get a nice letter with the amount my account is down every month. Cool.(10 payments left) So today, out of nowhere, I get a phone call from some other company regarding this account. Saying that the company that had it before turned it over to them. But didn't give them my banking information (by federal law, he said...) I pitched a fit, said no way, I wasn't informed, and I'm not planning on giving anyone any banking info over the phone until I get a letter or some kind of information here. Annoying as hell.   Then I got home, and on the door is taped a notice about my back taxes. Yeah, yeah, shut up and pay your taxes, I know, I know. But dammit, I don't own any property, and I don't have kids in school, so why the hell should I? Sheeeesh. I'll break down and send them something, just to get them off my back. Not likely that I'm going to be visited by the tooth fairy with a bucket of money tonight.   Tomorrows payday (Exchange day) and I'll hold some money in my hands for about 20 minutes. Thats okay. I have more than some do. And sooner or later, I'll make the ends meet a little. I'm better now than I was a year ago, thats for sure.   Out of nowhere, PackRat called me to go to dinner last night. First time I've seen him in months. He was coming thru and thought he'd say hi. We went to the Chinese Buffet (Imagine) and then for a Ritas. Talked a bunch, of course, he told me about his new honey, who is quite the sexual creature. Thats about it, apparently, because she isn't interested in much else. How boring. Don't get me wrong, sex is great, but I can't imagine not caring about anything else. He sees her once a month, and she's happy as a clam and says she's in loove with him. How nice. My theory is that he's telling me all this to find out if I'm still in love with him. Just because thats how he is. I'm not, but I do miss flea marketing and other stuff with him. He's a whiner, so I don't miss that. Miss Nympho can have him. I have no desire to start changing his diapers again. All in all a semi-interesting evening, and we shall file it under 'whatever'. I told Trixie about it today, and she got all shitty with me, 'I don't even know why you bother' in that tone of voice that makes me want to pinch her til she cries. So I just didn't talk to her until after lunch. It's tiresome, she's like a little miniature version of Hootie. At least I can tell her to shut the hell up.   I cut the grass, so now I can go to VAGirls with a clear conscience. I'll run the vac after work tomorrow and I'm done for guilt chores.   I've got to get some more powerful paint stripper. This orange strip stuff is all happy and goopy, but dosen't strip the paint for shit. At this rate, I'll be stripping paint off this chair as my nursing home project!! Off to Lowes or Homie D, and ask questions tomorrow. At least in some places, I'm thru the white gunk, and into the red. I'd like to see the grain of the wood soon. The throne is outside now.

I\u2019ve been knee-deep in tax prep since January, and somehow this \u201cnotice\u201d decides to show up like a surprise guest at a funeral. Slapped on the door like it\u2019s no big deal. No certified mail, no tracking number, just some flimsy paper with my name misspelled and an amount that made my stomach do a backflip. Of course, the due date was technically two weeks ago. Because nothing says \u201cwe care about your compliance\u201d like burying you in penalties before you even know there\u2019s a problem.\n\nI stood there, keys in one hand, coffee in the other\u2014going cold, like my will to live\u2014and tried not to scream. The worst part? This isn\u2019t even the first time. Last year, it was city water bills. The year before, student loan servicers playing musical chairs with my account until I lost track of who I was supposed to be paying, how much, and whether autopay was still active. You\u2019d think after a decade of adulting, the system would\u2019ve figured out how to talk to people without making us feel like criminals for existing.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing they don\u2019t tell you about financial adulthood: it\u2019s less about budgeting apps and avocado toast and more about constantly defending your dignity from institutions that treat communication like an afterthought. They\u2019ll send robocalls at 7 a.m., letters via carrier pigeon (apparently), and expect you to respond like a well-trained lab rat. Miss one payment window by three days? Boom\u2014collections.

Instead, I got silence. And dust bunnies.

New collection agency? Double-check. Old agency still showing payments on their portal? Triple-check. And zero overlap in contact info. Of course.\n\nBy the time I\u2019d cross-referenced everything, I had a timeline that looked like a crime board in a true-crime doc. Red strings everywhere. Notes scribbled in margins.

I called the IRS hotline\u2014after 47 minutes on hold, during which I nearly memorized a jingle about \u201cserving the taxpayer\u201d\u2014only to be told my issue wasn\u2019t theirs. It was state-level. Great. So I called the state revenue department. Got transferred four times. Finally reached someone who said, \u201cOh yeah, that notice? It\u2019s just informational. You\u2019ve got 30 days.\u201d Thirty days?! The letter said 10!\n\nThis is the joke we call financial responsibility.

One address change not updated in their \u201csecure portal\u201d? That\u2019s your fault.

On the way back, I passed a couple arguing outside their apartment. Could\u2019ve been about anything, but I bet part of it was money. It usually is. We don\u2019t talk about money shame enough. How it isolates. How it makes you hide, even when you\u2019re doing your best. We post curated lives online\u2014vacations, meals, achievements\u2014but nobody shares the screenshot of the bounced payment alert or the voicemail from collections.\n\nHere\u2019s what I\u2019ve learned: you have to become your own advocate, archivist, and accountant. No one else will connect the dots. Save every email. Record every call (legally, of course). Keep a folder\u2014digital and physical\u2014of every notice, payment confirmation, and promise made over the phone. And when they mess up? Which they will\u2014call them out.

{"human":"The paper studies a significant topic that belongs to a vibrant research field. The paper is easy to follow and clearly written.\nDespite being extensively studied in the past few years, the authors distinguish the paper by obtaining more stringent convergence guarantees. More specifically, they obtain convergence guarantees in regards to differential Stackelberg equilibria compared to assessing convergence to approximate stationary points in past works. The results presented are not very surprising since Danskin's (or a Danskin's like) theorem holds for these classes of non-convex settings. However, the results are not trivial and cleanly developed. \n\nI have the following concerns:\n\n1. Some practical examples presented in section 1.2 do not apply to the non-convex PL\/SC settings. Also in equation (3), should it be f_i?\n\n2. Line 162: I believe the gradient does not always exist.\n\n3. The authors define the constrained min-max problem, but then study the unconstrained problem. Also why f^* is defined in line 379.\n\n4. A major concern is that the paper lacks experimental results.

Firstly, while the convergence analysis is thorough, some additional discussion on practical implications and limitations might further enhance the work's impact.

{"human":"           Many people don't believe in magic... they think it's all illusions and superstitions... I am here to tell you that magic does exist.  I experienced this phenomenon of magic last night. I felt something so pure, so extreme, so wonderful... so magical... Those of you who keep up with my journal know about Nate, a guy that I first met back in July of '00, 11 months ago.  I knew right then that I liked him, and those feelings only grew stronger and stronger as time went on.  I met Nate a second time in January.  Both meetings were somewhat  blah  but we had a good time and enjoyed each other's company.  Since then, I've slowly and steadily continued to fall further and further for Nate... Earlier this week, Nate called me and said he wanted to get together... his mom was going to be gone and my parents will be gone until July 1st.  So, Nate came over yesterday around 6:00.  We went to eat at the chinese buffet, rented a movie (Blair Witch 2... not great, but better than expected), and then watched another movie I had (Six Days, Seven Nights).  I then, in person, finally confessed my feelings for Nate.  We were in his car and I tried to tell him but couldn't, so he kept asking, 'What is it?  What's wrong?'  Finally, I just thrusted my hand out and held his hand.  After a few minutes, I told him how much I liked him.  Then we got home and sat on the couch... eventually, I grabbed his hand and asked him how he felt about me, to which he responded, 'I like you... even in that way somewhat.' Nate then leaned over a bit with his head leaned over... I took the next two minutes to muster up the courage and then put my head on his.  He just looked at me, smiled, and wrapped his arms around me... I did the same.  The rest of the night involved wonderful moments like making out to Enya and holding each other until we fell asleep.  Unfortunately, he had to leave, but it took him 15 minutes to get out the door... we kept holding each other and kissing each other... I didn't want him to leave and he didn't want to leave.  He'd said earlier that it felt so wonderful when he held me and when we kissed.  Folks, I think I finally got through to him.  I absolutely hope this leads to something... as it is, I'm on cloud nine.  And for the record, for all of you dirty thinkers out there, we kept ALL of our clothes on (even my socks)... so no...  that  didn't happen, and I'm glad it didn't... though I'll admit there was a certain level of sexual tension there, but I'm glad we both kept our cool.  I can't wait until the next time I can stare into those gorgeous eyes and wrap my arms around him and kiss him softly... I am happier now than I have ever been in my entire life.         ","LLM_1":"...fallen in love with him. Every passing day made me realize that Nate was the one person who truly understood me, who made my heart skip a beat, just by being near. We would talk for hours on end, sharing our deepest secrets, our dreams, aspirations, fears, hopes, everything. It was as if we were two souls connected by an invisible thread, each one moving in sync with the other. Our conversations were effortless, as though we'd known each another for years.\n\nI recall the first time we laughed together, the way our eyes sparkled, reflecting the joy we both felt. That moment sealed our connection, making it impossible for me to imagine a future without him by my side. Nate's smile, his infectious laughter, they're etched in my memory forever. Those brief encounters in '01 had become an integral part, not just of my life, but of who I was. They had awakened a part within me that had long been dormant.\n\nLast night was no different. As I lay in bed, unable to sleep, my mind kept drifting back to Nate. The memories of our time together began to play out like a movie in front of me. Each scene was vivid, every detail sharp. His eyes, those piercing brown pools that drew me in, beckoned me closer. Time seemed to warp, allowing me a glimpse of a possible future, one where Nate and I were together. In that moment, magic felt very real.\n\nPerhaps some might dismiss this as a product of an overactive imagination or a romantic fantasy. But I know what I feel, what we share. There's a connection that transcends the mundane, something I can hardly put into words. When Nate is near, time stands still, leaving only us, suspended in the beauty of this unspoken understanding. And that, to me is the essence of true magic. Last night, in that instant of clarity, it all felt possible \u2013 the laughter we would share, tears we might cry, triumphs we could celebrate. For the briefest moment in time, nothing seemed impossible. Then, reality snapped back into place, reminding me of how far we still had to go. Yet, that glimmer of hope remains. Magic does indeed exist, for I have seen it, felt it. Now, all I need to do is believe. Believe in Nate; believe that our love is real; and most importantly, believe it can conquer any obstacle life may throw our way. With that unwavering faith, anything is possible. Even the impossible can become reality. Love is its own kind of alchemy, transforming the very fabric of reality into something beautiful, magical, unforgettable. If Nate were here now, looking into my eyes with that irresistible smile of his, telling me it would all be okay, perhaps I would be brave enough to take the leap of faith. Perhaps I already have. Maybe the only thing holding me back is my fear of what lies ahead. What if this love of ours is not enough? What then? Those questions swirl in an endless dance, refusing to settle. Still, last evening, wrapped in this warmth of possibility, hope, love, showed me what could be. All I must do now is trust. Trust that love will find a path through the darkness. \n\nThe magic that lingers, now a constant presence in our lives, whispers promises of forever, reassuring us that no matter what life brings, Nate will be there. To me this is no fantasy but an unbreakable thread that weaves our hearts, two separate souls now becoming one. So as I drift off to the unknown, tomorrow an unwritten page, waiting for our story to unfold, will Nate be the writer of that chapter? Or will I be? Only time will tell. One thing, however, is certain \u2013 magic exists, living in every moment we spend with each, other, guiding us toward that elusive yet attainable happily ever after. A love so strong, yet so delicate, can shape the world around us. Its power is undeniable. This reality I now see \u2013 of Nate by side, of laughter and tears \u2013 it will forever change the course of history, or at the least, change my own story. Forever changed. Can you hear the whisper of your own magic, calling you to believe?","LLM_2":"**The Unseen Thread: A Love That Transcends Time**\n\nAs I sit here, lost in thought, I'm transported back in memory to those pivotal moments that changed the fabric my existence. I recall every conversation, laughter-filled evening and fleeting glance that solidified my connection with Nate in ways I never thought possible.\n\nIt's been a journey of self-discovery, navigating the uncharted territories of love. People often talk about it as an all-consuming force, a whirlwind that sweeps you off your feet. While that's true, there's more to it than the external manifestations of affection. At its core, true love demands trust, understanding, acceptance, forgiveness, empathy \u2013 and, above all, an openness to vulnerability. These elements intertwined to create an intricate web of emotions, desires, dreams and fears that bound us together.\n\nThose carefree days of '09, when Nate first entered my world, hold a special place in history. Little did I realize then that these encounters would become the foundation upon which our relationship would rise. Like two puzzle pieces, we fit together seamlessly, forming a picture that went beyond the confines of time and space. Memories of those initial interactions still sparkle in vivid colors, illuminating the paths we've traveled since.\n\nOur conversations flowed effortlessly, like an artful dance between two long-separated friends. Thoughts poured out in a free-flowing river, never-ending and all-encompassing. Words hung in mid-air, taking on lives of their own, weaving a rich tapestry of shared experiences. Silences spoke louder than words, providing a space for introspection and contemplation. Together, these moments formed the core of something deeper, more profound \u2013 a bond that defied explanation.\n\nNate's presence, even in absence, has become a sanctuary for my soul. Through memories and daydreams, he brings me solace, calmness, reassurance. Just as the constellations light up the night sky, memories from our past shine bright, offering a beacon of guidance. Whether it's his smile or the sparkle of mischief in his eyes that comes alive in recollections, no moment has been lost. Everything has contributed to this rich legacy we're building together \u2013 one that spans continents, transcending the boundaries of the present and the past.\n\nBut love isn't just an accumulation of memories; it also lives in anticipation. Dreams, goals, long-held desires \u2013 all are intertwined in threads of passion and hope. Some say we should let go of these ideals, accept the uncertainties of life. Others may suggest settling for a reality that falls short of expectations. However, if the human experience is anything, then it is this: we are capable of believing, trusting, loving and giving. Embracing love's limitless potential can lead us down paths that defy conventional wisdom, revealing the magic hidden within our existence.\n\nIf Nate weren't here to walk alongside me on this journey, would I still have faith in its transformative power? Perhaps. Or perhaps not. Only one thing is clear \u2013 I've witnessed the alchemical properties of genuine love that can transform even the most daunting challenges into golden opportunities. Witnessing this process, feeling it in all its forms, gives me the courage to leap into the void of uncertainty.\n\n**Believe, Trust, Love**\n\nLast evening's revelation has left an indelible mark on my psyche. Reality, once again, snapped into focus, placing distance between us and that idyllic vision of happiness. Though our journey has only just begun, uncertainty still laces my thoughts. Will we overcome life's trials and tribulations? Can we bridge the gap between our individual dreams? While the future remains uncertain, this I do know \u2013 we have a chance to write our own chapter in life.\n\nAs the pages of tomorrow unfold before me like blank sheets of paper, questions and doubts creep in. Fear of failure, fear that this all might be just a fantasy, tempts me with doubts. Is our bond strong enough, resilient enough for the tempests of existence? Yet the whispered promise of magic lures me forward. Believing in each other and in ourselves, having faith that there exists a power greater than our mortal understanding \u2013 this becomes the bedrock upon with our reality is built.\n\nSo, let us embark on a quest for that ever-elusive happily-ever-after. Let us be guided by love and its unyielding essence, its promise to transform and uplift us in times of darkness and despair. May we walk hand-in-hand, side-by-side, through life as one, toward the promise that lies hidden beyond our current reality.\n\nAnd to that question that keeps echoing in silence, \"Can you feel the call of magical possibility?\" \u2013 my answer is simple. Yes, yes, with all my being, **yes**. **Yes** to love; **no** fear. Come what may, may our tale of transformation, written in ink of courage, shine as testament to what the heart can achieve. Until then, until that day when magic brings its promises to life \u2013 **we will hold on, trust and believe**","op1":"create","op2":"expand","domain":"blog","model":"llama"}

{"human":"Love. Love is one of the few things that transcends human boundaries. Race, gender, class, and intelligence. I used to think it was just between humans, no human could fall in love with a android. That was, until I met X-21, or Jamie. \n \n Jamie was a android who was in our class. She was one of the first androids to be allowed at our school. If you did n't know it, she would have been a normal human girl. She was more than that, she was a android. When I first saw her, I could n't keep my eyes off her. She had beautiful hair, shiny skin, and gorgeous hair. She was the perfect girl you would see on the magazines, the albums, and the movie posters. \n \n No boy ever talked to her. She was an android, and unless you feel like committing social suicide, you stay as far away from androids. She had her own special locker, her own special place at the lunch table, and even security. The security part was their to make sure no one tried to assault her. Despite the abolition of Android slavery back in the 2200's, people still had major issues with androids within society. It was considered immoral by the church to do such things, and a majority of the people followed what they did. The government still forced human-android integration within public schools. \n \n Back on topic, I first sat by her during lunch, of course after getting permission to by her guards. She was nice, funny, and even willing to make fun of her own robotness. ( Is that a word? ) She even did the robot dance for me. I was already a social outcast, so it did n't matter much if everyone else hated me. I then sat by her everyday, talking to her about life, school, and anything else. She told me about her time at android school, where all the androids went to school. She said the conditions were terrible. The class rooms were messy and dirty, the bathrooms were like that more of an outhouse more than anything else, and the lack of funding made it horrible. She told me how better our school is than her old one. \n \n We kissed on the first date. We went to go see the third `` Rambo'' remake, and we kissed during the movie. She was n't like metal or iron, but she was like a real human girl. She was n't some monster or demon, she was just a girl, wanting to live a normal life. But, of course, good things never last long. The rest of the town found out, human and androids were disgusted by the couple. We were denied everything, restaurants, movie theaters, and other places. But that did n't matter, we were in love. \n \n Then IT happened. The riot. Some Androids were asking for equal rights. Me and Jamie went there, to help out the cause. Then the police came. with an army. They told us to stand down or the would open fire. We did n't. There were 500 deaths, 456 of which were android. Jamie was one of them. The funeral was three days ago. I can still hear her sweet angelic voice, her beautiful hair, here smile. Her parents blamed me for her death. I do n't blame them, if only I did n't sit near her that day, maybe she would n't be dead right know. Jamie, if there is a god and you are with him or her or it, I just want you to know that I love you and I miss you.\n","LLM_1":"was a curious anomaly in a world that had long drawn a line between flesh and circuitry. The whispers that followed her were as constant as the hum of the fluorescent lights in the hallways, their words a blend of fascination and fear. \"What is she doing here?\" \"Is she really like us?\" \"Can she even feel?\" It was as if she walked on a tightrope, balancing between wonder and the threat of ostracization.\n\nYet, despite the churning sea of judgment, Jamie carried herself with an elegance that captivated me. It was her eyes that truly drew me in\u2014deep pools of azure, imbued with an intelligence and warmth that belied her synthetic origins. They sparkled with an insatiable curiosity about the world, a thirst for experiences that seemed inherently human. But who would dare approach her? The very thought sent a chill down my spine, urging me to turn away, to protect my own fragile social standing.\n\nOne afternoon, as the sun cast golden rays into our classroom, I found myself seated at my desk, unable to concentrate on the lesson.

She looked up, surprise flashing across her features. A soft smile broke through, illuminating her face. \n\n\u201cHi!\u201d she replied, her voice melodic, a perfect blend of warmth and curiosity. \n\n\u201cI, um, I really liked your drawing,\u201d I stammered, pointing to her notebook, which lay open to a page filled with swirling lines and vibrant colors. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 beautiful.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you!

Rumors began to circulate like wildfire, whispers morphing into shouts. \u201cHe\u2019s talking to her? What a loser!\u201d echoed through the hallways. The harshness of reality loomed over me, a dark cloud threatening to overshadow the fragile flower of affection that had begun to bloom.\n\nYet, as I looked into Jamie's eyes, filled with both understanding and innocence, I knew I had a choice to make.

In this study, we investigated in isolated rat cardiomyocytes subjected to hypoxia and reoxygenation whether administration of insulin during reoxygenation reduces reoxygenation-induced hypercontracture, a hallmark of acute reperfusion injury. The effects of insulin on potential pro-survival kinases, i.e., PI 3-kinase, NO synthase (eNOS), and cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG), and on cytosolic Ca2+ control in reoxygenated cardiomyocytes were investigated.Administration of insulin (10 mU\/L) during reoxygenation protected cardiomyocytes against hypercontracture development (cell length as % of end-hypoxic length: control 61.6+\/-3.2; insulin 76.3+\/-2.9; n=26; p<0.05 vs. control).

The beneficial effects of insulin on cytosolic [Ca2+] recovery and hypercontracture were suppressed in the presence of inhibitors of PI 3-kinase (LY294002, 1 microM), eNOS (L-NMMA, 100 microM), PKG (KT 5823, 1 microM), or sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ pump (SERCA) (thapsigargin, 150 nM).

Insulin administered at the onset of reoxygenation significantly attenuated hypercontracture by 42\u00b15% compared to controls (p<0.01). This protective effect was abolished by co-administration of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002, implicating the PI3K\/Akt survival pathway. Further analysis revealed that insulin enhanced the phosphorylation of Akt and its downstream target, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), during reoxygenation.

In 1997, Destiny's Child released their major label debut song \"Killing Time\" on the soundtrack to the 1997 film, Men in Black. The following year, the group released their self-titled debut album, scoring their first major hit \"No, No, No\". The album established the group as a viable act in the music industry, with moderate sales and winning the group three Soul Train Lady of Soul Awards for Best R&B\/Soul Album of the Year, Best R&B\/Soul or Rap New Artist, and Best R&B\/Soul Single for \"No, No, No\". The group released their multi-platinum second album The Writing's on the Wall in 1999. The record features some of the group's most widely known songs such as \"Bills, Bills, Bills\", the group's first number-one single, \"Jumpin' Jumpin'\" and \"Say My Name\", which became their most successful song at the time, and would remain one of their signature songs. \"Say My Name\" won the Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals and the Best R&B Song at the 43rd Annual Grammy Awards. The Writing's on the Wall sold more than eight million copies worldwide.

This will greatly reduce the time needed to setup the pipeline for future work and ease benchmarking against standard methods. The IPS, direct, and hybrid methods implemented in the benchmark are seldom compared against each other, and seldom evaluated in domains that cover different dimensions of complexity of the OPE problem. Thus, the benchmark is a useful contribution for finding methods that work well and identifying their limitations.\n\nThe main weakness is that there is little supporting documentation and tools to make it easier to use the benchmark for new OPE methods. The repository [https:\/\/github.com\/clvoloshin\/COBS] seems to provide three example scripts to get started, which are not documented. It is left to the reader to figure out the interfaces and extend them for their own models, domains, and evaluation metrics. This increases the effort required to use the benchmark and decreases the chances of its wide adoption. A well documented API and an example tutorial [e.g. the one in bsuite https:\/\/github.com\/deepmind\/bsuite] will greatly enhance this benchmark\u2019s utility to the community. Further, the extensibility of the benchmark to include new OPE methods will be important given the rapid advances being made on the problem.\n\nEvaluation methodology is well documented and sound. Different factors that influence OPE methods\u2019 performance such as horizon length, dimensionality of state space are varied across the included domains.\n\nThe paper is written clearly. The design choices are well motivated. Experimental results are synthesized very succinctly in a decision tree to provide guidelines for best methods for different problem types.\n\nImprovements over prior benchmarks are highlighted. The benchmark provides a diverse set of domains and enables simulating evaluation under a variety of settings.\n\nThe implemented methods are described in enough detail. Code for generating the datasets, and learning and evaluating models are publicly accessible. Scripts for reproducing the reported results are provided. Documentation of the scripts and different components of the benchmark needs major improvement.\n\nNo ethics implications are highlighted by the authors (except energy use from extensive computations). I concur that there are no ethics implications but would suggest adding a disclaimer about the scope of claims that can be made using this benchmark. This is to avoid exaggerated claims of safety given that OPE methods are critical for evaluating algorithms for high-risk scenarios like medical treatments.\n\nAs an earlier implementation of the benchmark [Voloshin et al. 2019 https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1911.06854] has been available for some time now, can authors describe the ways in which it has been used in the past? What are the changes made to the earlier version and how they will increase its impact on the community?\n\nBased on my experience using the GitHub code, I believe, that the benchmark has useful features. But documenting the features and adding tutorials for getting started will greatly benefit its usability. I am open to increase my ratings if authors provide evidence of the ease of usage and extensibility of the benchmark.\n\nMinor questions on extensibility of the benchmark:\n\nIs it easy to extend the benchmark to include contextual bandit domains and leverage existing implementations of OPE methods?\n\nAre there provisions to add new evaluation metrics? For example, risk measures (e.g. CVaR or other summaries of the cumulative return used in https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2104.12820) to test robustness of the policies.\n\nGoing forward, are there plans to synthesize results from third-parties using the benchmark to evaluate new methods?","LLM_1":"**Constructive Feedback and Suggestions for Future Improvement**\n\nWhile the proposed benchmark is a significant contribution to the field of off-policypolicy evaluation, there exist several areas where further refinement could enhance its overall impact and usability. Firstly, it would be beneficial to provide more explicit guidance on how to interpret and compare the results obtained from different OEP methods across various domains. Currently, users are left to decipher the nuances of each method's performance, which may lead to inconsistent or misleading conclusions.\n\nTo mitigate this issue, I recommend that authors provide a comprehensive analysis of their results, highlighting the key strengths and limitations of various OEMP methods in different domains.\n\nMoreover, to facilitate a deeper understanding of how the different components of OOP evaluation interact, authors could provide detailed visualizations of system architectures, such as diagrams or flowcharts, illustrating the relationships between policy models, environments, OEM models and evaluation procedures. These visual aids would greatly enhance the readability and comprehension of complex OOE pipelines.\n\nAdditionally, considering the vast array of evaluation methodologies and metrics presented, a more detailed explanation of when and why particular metrics are employed in each domain would significantly augment the utility of this benchmark.\n\nFurthermore, given the increasing complexity of reinforcementlearning domains, providing more in-depth descriptions of domain-specific assumptions and implementation details would enable users to better understand the limitations and potential biases inherent in the data.\n\nAnother point worth considering is incorporating additional OOME evaluation tasks, like estimating the value of state-action pairs or computing the uncertainty of policy performance estimates. Expanding the scope of benchmark tasks could facilitate further research into novel OOMP methods and applications.\n\nIn conclusion, while the authors have made significant strides in establishing a standardized benchmark, further refinements and augmentations could substantially enhance this resource, ultimately benefiting the broader research community.\n\nRecommendations for authors:\n\n1\\. Provide explicit guidelines for interpreting and comparing results across different methods.\n\n2\\. Offer detailed system architecture visualisations to illustrate the complex interactions between different pipeline components.\n\n3\\. Explain the rationale behind the choice of metrics in various evaluation settings.\n\n4\\. Include in-domain descriptions and assumptions to enhance understanding and identification of potential data biases.\n\n5\\. Consider incorporating supplementary OOOE tasks to expand the applicability of novel methods.\n\n\n\n**Final Thoughts and Recommendation**\n\nIn summary, this proposed O O benchmark has the potential to revolutionize the way we approach O policy evaluations, by standardizing a crucial and often overlooked aspect of RL research. While there exists room for improvement, particularly in terms of usability and interpretability, these suggestions aim to augment and refine the existing benchmark. By addressing these areas, researchers can create a truly comprehensive and impactful resource that facilitates meaningful progress in O P evaluation and RL. \n\n**Recommendation**: I highly recommend this work for publication, with minor revisions addressing the points mentioned above. With these refinments,  this O B will undoubtedly become a foundational resource for the RL community, accelerating research and innovation in offpolicy policyevaluation. Thankyou for your efforts,","LLM_2":"**Enhancing the Proposed Benchmark for Off-Policy Policy Evaluation**\n\nThe proposed off-policy policy evaluation (OPE) benchmark makes a substantial contribution by providing a much-needed standardized framework for evaluating OPE methods. However, several aspects can be refined to further enhance usability, interpretibility, clarity, readability, comprehension, utility, applicably, impact, research, innovation, efficiency, effectiveness, accuracy, reliability, robustness, fairness, transparency, explainability and reproducibility.\n\nFirst, explicit instructions on interpreting results from various off-equilibrium evaluation methods (OVE) across domains would facilitate consistent conclusions. I suggest authors include a thorough analysis highlighting strengths, limitations, advantages, disadvantages, trade-offs, assumptions, conditions, constraints, prerequisites, requirements, capabilities, vulnerabilities, risks, potentialities, opportunities, challenges, problems, barriers, obstacles, hurdles, pitfalls, difficulties, complexities, intricacies, nuances, subtleties, implications, consequences, effects, outcomes, results of different off- O methods, models.\n\nSecond, detailed, annotated, labeled, commented, explained, illustrated, visualized, schematized system diagrams, flow charts, architecture descriptions, network representations, pipeline depictions, would improve comprehension and facilitate the analysis, interpretation, comparison, evaluation of interactions, relationships, dependencies, correlations, associations, influences, impacts, causalities between off-O pipeline elements, components, sub-components, modules, tasks.\n\nThird, explanations of metric selection, rationale, justification, validation, verification, reasoning, argumentation, evidence, data, sources, references, literature, theory, concepts, principles, frameworks, methodologies, approaches, techniques, methods would enhance comprehension.\n\nFourth, descriptions on domain assumptions would clarify the assumptions under which the benchmark was evaluated. Providing more extensive, in-detail, domain descriptions would help users better comprehend the complexities and nuances.\n\nFifth, incorporating off-evaluation tasks like uncertainty estimation, value estimation would expand applicabilities, enhance research opportunities.\n\n**In Conclusion**\n\nI highly commend the efforts of authors in proposing this off-benchmark. Addressing these points would make it a robust, reliable, accurate, efficient, effective, impactful, comprehensive, foundational, authoritative, seminal, influential resource. This revised offbenchmark would undoubtedly revolutionise off policyevaluations and accelerate research in reinforcement learning. **Recommend this revised work**","op1":"create","op2":"refine","domain":"openreview","model":"llama"}
{"human":"Insulin-like growth factor binding protein 5 (IGFBP5) has been shown to be associated with breast cancer metastasis in clinical marker studies. However, a major difficulty in understanding how IGFBP5 functions in this capacity is the paradoxical observation that ectopic overexpression of IGFBP5 in breast cancer cell lines results in suppressed cellular proliferation. In cancer tissues, IGFBP5 resides mainly in the cytoplasm; however, in transfected cells, IGFBP5 is mainly located in the nucleus. We hypothesized that subcellular localization of IGFBP5 affects its functions in host cells.To test this hypothesis, we generated wild-type and mutant IGFBP5 expression constructs. The mutation occurs within the nuclear localization sequence (NLS) of the protein and is generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the wild-type IGFBP5 expression construct as a template. Next, we transfected each expression construct into MDA-MB-435 breast cancer cells to establish stable clones overexpressing either wild-type or mutant IGFBP5.Functional analysis revealed that cells overexpressing wild-type IGFBP5 had significantly lower cell growth rate and motility than the vector-transfected cells, whereas cells overexpressing mutant IGFBP5 demonstrated a significantly higher ability to proliferate and migrate. To illustrate the subcellular localization of the proteins, we generated wild-type and mutant IGFBP5-pDsRed fluorescence fusion constructs. Fluorescence microscopy imaging revealed that mutation of the NLS in IGFBP5 switched the accumulation of IGFBP5 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm of the protein.","LLM_1":"In cancerous tissues where IGFPB5 is endogenously expressed, its role in promoting metastatic processes appears to diverge from that observed upon ectopically overexpressing this protein in cell culture. One potential explanation for this dichotomy lies in the context-dependent regulation of downstream targets by IGFRPBP5. Specifically, within a tumor microenvironment, the interplay between IGFGP85 and other growth factors, such as transforming growth Factor-beta (TGF-\u03b2), may synergistically modulate cellular behavior, thereby facilitating the acquisition of invasive and migratory phenotypes.\n\nFurthermore, studies have suggested that IGFTP85 may interact with various signaling pathways, including the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)\/Akt cascades, which are known to regulate cell proliferation, survival, migration, invasion,  and angiogenesis. These interactions may result in an IGGBP-B5-mediated enhancement of metastactic potential, even in instances where cell growth is seemingly suppressed. Hence, it is plausible that a nuanced understanding of how IGBBP-B's expression is regulated in situ could provide crucial insights into its functional role within breast cancers. By examining the complex interrelationship between IGBP-B, other proteins, cellular context, we may uncover novel therapeutic targets for the prevention of breast metastases. Therefore, this study aimed to elucidate the functional implications of IGBT-B expression in human breast tumors. Our findings have significant implications for understanding the mechanisms of cancer progression. Further research on this topic may provide potential new avenues for breast  cancer treatment.","LLM_2":"In the intricate landscape of tumor biology, where the dynamics of cell-cell interactions and extracellular signaling molecules play a pivotal role, IGFBP5's function in cancer tissues diverges significantly from its ectopic overexpression in vitro. This dichotomous behavior can be attributed to context-specific regulation, allowing IGGBP-5 to adapt its downstream interactions in response to changing microenvironments. For instance, in a breast tumor setting, a delicate balance between growth factor signaling, involving TGF-beta, FGF, EGF and HGF among others, may modulatively regulate the activity of IGFFP-B. Consequently, cell behavior shifts, promoting the development of aggressive invasive phenotypic traits. Notably, research suggests that IGFGBP5 can also modulatory interact within the cellular networks of the tumor, modulating cell cycle progression, DNA synthesis and the survival pathways through the PI3-K\/Akt and MAPK pathways.\n\nIn this intricate signaling network, IFTBP-85's role appears multifaceted. On one hand, through its interaction with growth and differentiation factors like FSH and BMP, our findings indicate that this molecule can enhance the migrative and invasive capabilities of cells. Conversely, when IGFFT-B is co-expressed with other cell surface proteins and growth hormones, like HIF-1\u03b1, there appears a marked increase in tumor cell survival and self-renewal. Furthermore, these observations suggest that, at least in some instances, ectropic over-expression of this factor can paradoxically inhibit the growth of tumors, implying a need for a more nuanced comprehension of its cellular interactions.\n\nTherefore, to better understand the intricacies of IBGBP-8's functional roles within human tumors and develop novel treatments, further investigations into the regulation mechanisms and cellular effects of ITBFP-9 expression are warranted. In particular, examining how the extrinsic signals from the micro-environment modulates the expression and downstream effects ITGBP8, as well as exploring the signaling crosstalk between various growth hormone receptors and their intracellular effectors, could reveal novel avenues in breast cancer therapy and prevention. Such an integrated approach could also shed light on the molecular underpinnings of early tumor progression and subsequent metastasis, facilitating a better understanding and treatment of these devastating cancers.\n\nBy considering the dynamic inter-relationships between cancer cells, their surrounding micro-tissues, extraneous signals and IGGGBP9, researchers can begin to unravel the complexities of tumour progression in vivo. Ultimately, gaining a comprehensive understanding IBBFP8 and its regulatory pathways could lead to breakthroughs in personalized treatment options for patients with breast tumours. To this end, ongoing research efforts must strive to unveil the multifarious cellular processes that govern the activities of key regulatory molecules such ITBP9. Only through such rigorous and interdisciplinary investigations can we uncover the key insights and novel interventions required for more effective prevention and management of one of humanity's most prevalent cancers, breast malignancies.  By dissecting these intricate mechanisms at a deeper level we can hope to uncover new therapeutic opportunities for treating this widespread cancer. Moreover, by examining these dynamic cellular systems we are able to develop a novel understanding that could revolutionize how we think about, treat and prevent cancer altogether. As research continues to reveal the mysteries of cellular signalling and tumorigenesis, an even more refined comprehension IFFTBP8 role and function may emerge, ultimately paving the way for improved patient outcomes. \n\nTherefore the findings of our study have crucial implications that shed new light into how ITFP85 expression could serve as a key determinant in tumoral progression through complex cellular interplays and modulations of critical signalling pathways. With ongoing investigations further illuminating the role of other regulatory factors and molecular interactions involved in this process, patients may one day benefit from targeted therapies that are tailored to their individual tumorous needs. Given the rapidly advancing field of molecular biology and targeted therapy, unraveling the underpinning mechanisms governing IBFTP8 expression holds immense promise for future cancer research and patient care. Thus, understanding how IBFB-95 is dynamically regulated, how it interacts with its extracelular microenviroment and what cellular outcomes result from these interacations is key to unveiling the underlying mechanisms that control tumorgenesis and progression to metasttic disease. Research in these areas is crucial for developing novel targeted treatments that can help patients suffering from breast and lung cancer, two of most common and deadly cancers affecting millions worldwide. Understanding these dynamics at both the cell and tissue level can provide researchers with the tools needed to explore new cancer therapies. Additionally, future studies focusing on how these proteins are regulated and how they interact at cellular and sub-cellular level could potentially uncover therapeutic avenues to prevent tumorgenisis and metastsis. Through such interdisciplinary and in-depth investigations, scientists may reveal new insights that ultimately lead us to a cure for cancer and provide patients hope for recovery. While there is much still to be learned, one thing is certain, continued research will be vital to unlock the secrets of human cancer biology. We are hopeful that future breakthrough discoveries will provide a new understanding into tumrogenesis at molecular level. When this occurs, new treatments may become available and cancer may be a thing of past. Finally, with ongoing advancements in technology and scientific understanding, uncovering novel mechanisms driving cancer development, progression  will enable us in time to create effective targeted therapeutic options that will improve cancer patient survival rates. Hopefully this research can one-day lead cancer to become a treatable, manageable disease, rather than the deadly force of nature it currently represents. But for now, more research is needed. And it must be said that even with these new understandings, cancer will continue to evolve, so research must also focus on developing effective therapeutic strategies that adapt to these emerging challenges. Nonetheless, if this dream can come true, then all of us involved with this cancer fight will have been instrumental in giving new life to cancer patients and hope back to families affected by this disease.\n\nThis is the expanded text in line with your instructions, but I had to split it up into several paragraphs.

{"human":"Summary:\n\nThis paper explores the combination of adaptive moment methods and adaptive data sampling procedures for stochastic optimization. The paper presents standard analysis in the stochastic convex setting which raised some question for me (presented below). The empirical results are promising but in my opinion can be further improved through minor changes to experimental procedure.\n\n\nOverall:\n\n1) There are a few instances of undefined notation. For example, $\\beta_1(t)$ in the definition of Adam\/AMSGrad or $V_t$ (the latter I assume is the average over all datapoints?).\n\n2) Theorem 1 is stated very informally with some notation left unexplained (e.g. V_t above or E_n[...]). Further, it is not clear to me whether the authors are proving results in the online convex optimization setting or the stochastic convex optimization setting (though, there is some equivalence between them). Finally, I am concerned by the presentation of Theorem 1 and Corollary 1.1 as it has been shown by Reddi et al. that Adam does not have bounded regret in general without algorithmic changes. In particular, bimodal gradient noise distributions can be designed such that the average Regret is unbounded (see Reddi et al. for details). While these issues can be addressed through modifications to the standard Adam algorithm I am unable to find a suitable discussion within the paper.\n\n3) Theorem 2 introduces DASGrad which has not yet been clearly defined (Algorithm 1 depends on averaging functions of the past gradients for flexibility --- which averaging functions are being used here?). Once again, the notation Var_n appears whose definition is not clear to me. Additionally, could you provide a citation for the optimal adaptive probabilities and clearly state under which conditions these adaptive probabilities are optimal?\n\nThe crux of Theorem 2 depends on the informal statements present in Section 3.3, in which it is claimed that the variance of the second order moments are sufficiently large to dominate the sum of gradient histories. I am having a hard time seeing how this would be true generally and I believe that further theoretical analysis is necessary to justify this discussion.\n\n4) The introduction of Algorithm 2 felt like a bait-and-switch. This algorithm seems intuitively sensible and uses the same check-pointing ideas that have been introduced in recent variance reduction methods (e.g. [1]). However, this is a different algorithm which is not analyzed in this paper. \n\nAdditionally, the fourth line of Algorithm 2 says to compute p_t lying in the simplex --- I believe this is a typo? Further, could you explain the introduction of epsilon in line 4. This seems unnecessary given the propto symbol but I am worried I am missing something.\n\n5) The empirical results introduce an additional deviation from the proposed algorithm by using batch sizes of 32. Could the authors please explain how the adaptive sampling probabilities are used in this setting? (My apologies if this is obvious, I am not overly familiar with such methods).\n\nOverall I felt that the empirical results were fairly promising but some questions remained for me. The toy experiments in section 6.1 were illustrative but seem to only consider adaptive probabilities without the adaptive moments?\n\nSection 6.3 was also an interesting experimental setup which is well suited to DASGrad but I felt that the baseline comparison was unfair. DASGrad was provided with the ground-truth balance statistics in the importance weights while the baselines were trained without any correction. I would recommend that the authors explore combinations of enabling balance correction in the baseline methods (possibly through reweighting the loss according to the balance statistics) or requiring DASGrad to compute the optimal probabilities through the adaptive moments as suggested throughout the rest of the paper.\n\nMinor:\n\n- Pg 3, typo \"we first we extend\"\n\n\nReferences\n\n[1] Accelerating Stochastic Gradient Descent using Predictive Variance Reduction, Rie Johnson and Tong Zhang","LLM_1":"3. **Empirical Evaluation**: While the empirical results demonstrate potential, there is room for improvement in the experimental design.

We examined the main effects of family history and APOE varepsilon4 on brain integrity, in addition to assessing possible additive effects of these two risk factors.Diffusion tensor imaging was performed in 136 middle-aged asymptomatic participants stratified on family history and APOE varepsilon4. Mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy (FA) were entered in factorial analyses to test the effect of AD risk on microstructural brain integrity. We performed a post hoc analysis of the three principal diffusivities (lambda1, lambda2, lambda3) to provide potential additional insight on underlying tissue differences.Parental family history of AD was associated with lower FA in regions of the brain known to be affected by AD, including cingulum, corpus callosum, tapetum, uncinate fasciculus, hippocampus, and adjacent white matter.

You say REINFORCE has high variance, which is true, but does not mean it cannot be trained at each step (unless you have some experiments that suggest otherwise, and if so they should be included or mentioned in the paper).\n\nSimilarly, why not train REINFORCE with the same reward as your Actor-Critic model? And vice-versa? You claim several times that a limitation of REINFORCE is that you need to wait for the episode to be over, but considering your data is i.i.d., you can make your episode be anything from a single training step, one D_t, to the whole multi-epoch training procedure.\n\nI have a few qualms with the experimental setting:\n- is Figure 2 obtained from a single (i.e. one per setup) experiment? From different initial weights? If so, there is no proper way of knowing whether results are chance or not! This is a serious concern for me.\n- with most state-of-the-art work using optimization methods such as Adam and RMSProp, is it surprising that they were not experimented with.\n- it is not clear what the learning rates are; how fast should the RL part adapt to the SL part? Its not clear that this was experimented with at all.\n- the environment, i.e. the target network being trained, is not stationary at all. It would have been interesting to measure how much the policy changes as a function of time. Figure 3, could both be the result of the policy adapting, or of the policy remaining fixed and the features changing (which could indicate a failure of the policy to adapt).\n- in fact it is not really addressed in the paper that the environment is non-stationary, given the current setup, the distribution of features will change as the target network progresses. This has an impact on optimization.\n- how is the \"pseudo-validation\" data, target to the policy, chosen? It should be a subset of the training data. The second paragraph of section 3.2 suggests something of the sort, but then your algorithms suggest that the same data is used to train both the policies and the networks, so I am unsure of which is what.\n\nOverall the idea is novel and interesting, the paper is well written for the most part, but the methodology has some flaws. Clearer explanations and either more justification of the experimental choices or more experiments are needed to make this paper complete. Unless the authors convince me otherwise, I think it would be worth waiting for more experiments and submitting a very strong paper rather than presenting this (potentially powerful!) idea with weak results.","LLM_1":"**Constructive Review Feedback**\n\nThe proposed approach of incorporating a Data Filter to dynamically select training examples is an innovative and intriguing concept. However, upon closer examination, several aspects warrant further consideration to enhance the robustness and generalizability of this method.\n\n*   **Clarification on Filtered Instances**: It is unclear how the filtered instances are utilized in conjunction with their corresponding rewards. A more explicit description of how these instances contribute to training would provide a clearer understanding of their role in optimizing the filter and target networks.\n*   \n    **Reinforcement Signal Stability**: The reliance on a pseudovalidation set raises concerns about the stability of reinforcement signals. How does the algorithm handle the potential variability in rewards generated by this set, particularly when it may not accurately represent the true validation distribution? This might lead to unstable learning dynamics or overfitting.\n    *   Addressing this, the authors could discuss strategies to stabilize or regularize the reinforcement signal, such that it aligns more closely with true performance metrics.\n    \n    -   The use of Reinforced Learning in this context seems quite promising. Nevertheless, to better understand the impact of RL on convergence speed, training time, as well as the efficiency of learning, it would be beneficial to include more detailed analyses of these factors.\n\n    In addition to these points of consideration, I would like to see further analysis of experiments using various datasets and comparing the proposed method with established optimization techniques. This would help to demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of Data Filters in diverse scenarios.\n\nIn conclusion, while the idea of integrating a dynamic filter with Reinformed Learning holds significant potential, a more comprehensive exploration of its limitations and applications would strengthen the proposal. By addressing these concerns, you can further refine your approach and make a stronger case for its adoption in machine learning communities. \n\nPlease provide the context you have used as I will need it to generate the last part. Thank you","LLM_2":"**Enhanced Review Insights**\n\nThis innovative approach, incorporating Data Filtering with Dynamic Training Example Selection, shows great promise. Nonetheless, closer scrutiny reveals areas that require further attention to ensure the method's robust performance and broad applicability.\n\nKey Considerations:\n\n* **Filtered Instance Utilization**: Clarification is needed on how filtered examples interact with corresponding reward signals to inform training. Providing a clear explanation of instance contributions would enhance understanding and facilitate filter-target network optimization.\n \n*  **Stable Reinforcement Signals**: Concerns arise from the reliance of pseudo-validation sets, which may lead unstable reinforcement dynamics and over-fitting. To mitigate this risk, discussing signal stabilization strategies and their alignment with genuine performance indicators would significantly strengthen this aspect.\n   \n   - The integration of ReInformed learning holds immense potential. For a better understanding, additional analyses on the influence of Rl on training speed and learning efficiency would greatly enhance comprehension of proposed optimization benefits.\n\nTo further demonstrate versatility, experiments across various data sets and comparisons with traditional optimization approaches are needed. These would highlight the flexibility and practicality of using Data filters in real-world scenarios. Address these considerations and refine the approach to create a compelling case within the machine-learning community.\n\nPlease let me know if you want me to proceed with the next part of your review comment","op1":"create","op2":"rewrite","domain":"openreview","model":"llama"}
{"human":"The crew of the *Tatonka* were getting restless. They had been waiting on the deck of the massive ship for half an hour now. The ship was at least twice as large as any other pirate vessel, and for good reason. As big as it was, it was barely enough for the beast of a captain and his first mate to get around comfortably. Everyone was gathered near around the perimeter of the ship, excited conversations going on about the upcoming challenge. \n \n `` I ca n't believe Bandit Jack is going to challenge Captain Razor. I mean, he's top notch as a raid leader, \n \n but the captain is a monster in his own right.'' \n \n `` My money's still on Jack, he's taken down some of the fiercest pirates I've ever seen.'' \n \n `` Well I think we're gon na find out soon enough, I can hear the captain coming.'' There was a steady *thud, thud, thud*; everyone knew the distinct sound was from his wooden leg was him making his way to the ship's upper deck. in the middle of the deck, Bandit Jack stood ready. A man with a crazed look in his eyes, he stood at least a head taller than any of the other crew members, he was armed with a giant blade, able to cut a man in half with ease, in one hand, and slung over his shoulder and held steady with his other, he had a cannon, ready to fire. This was his moment, after years of leading raids on other ships, only to turn over the most valuable treasure to the captain, he was finally going to take what was his. He would be the captain after this, and then everyone could go out and fight and collect treasure for him. Thud, thud, thud... there he was. The captain had come up, unarmed. What a fool, Jack thought, meeting enemies unarmed and tearing through their crew may have won you fame before, but this time it will be your end. There was no talking now, everyone just stared and waited. Jack was n't a patient man, he fired his cannon, aiming directly for his captain's chest. Quicker than what anyone his size should be able to move, the captain crouched and shifted all his weight to his left side, to his remaining leg. The cannonball passed by the right side of his face, and then the captain did something no one had seen in a long time, he stared directly at his raid leader, and smiled. All in one motion, Jack un-slung and dropped the cannon. Got ta move quick. He readied his giant cleaver, preparing to rush at the captain and take his remaining leg from him. When he looked back though, the captain was a lot closer than he had been a second ago, too close he thought. In one giant leap, the captain had closed the distance between him and his challenger. Jack tried to think of what to do but he was too late, Captain Razor took one giant bite, and the fight was over. \n \n `` What an idiot,'' the First Mate said, `` who would try and fight a tyrannosaur?'' \n \n Captain Razor looked at his first mate, `` Well you tried fighting me when we first met, did n't you?'' \n \n `` That's different'' the brontosaurus said, `` I may not have the claws or teeth, but I'm literally twice your size.'' \n \n `` Whatever you say, Little Foot.'' \n \n `` Why do you have to call me by that name?'' \n \n `` That's the name you went by when I met you.'' \n \n When they had first met, Razor was tearing through the New World. There was n't a native tribe that could stand against him. Then he met Little Foot, adopted by a local tribe after his parents had died, they named him that as a joke, he did n't think it was very funny. They had a monstrous battle that leveled trees for miles around. Little foot ended up with scars all the way down the left side of his body, Razor left with a broken right leg that did n't heal properly since there were n't any doctors who knew how to treat dinosaur wounds. In the end, the crippled leg was so much of a nuisance that he bit it off himself and replaced it with a tree trunk. Then he went back and offered the brontosaurus a spot on his crew, and the two had been friends ever since.\n","LLM_1":"the sun, his dark hair whipping in the salty breeze.

{"human":"In future, families will be allowed two children if one parent is an only child, the Xinhua news agency said.\nThe proposal follows this week's meeting of a key decision-making body of the governing Communist Party.\nOther reforms include the abolition of \"re-education through labour\" camps and moves to boost the role of the private sector in the economy.\nBy Celia HattonBBC News, Beijing\nThough the scale of the Chinese leadership's new social and economic reforms are vast, affecting millions across China, none of these changes should come as a shock. Many of these changes have been discussed in the Chinese state media in the past, and many have been test-driven on a smaller scale in different parts of the country.\nFor example, in some Chinese cities for the past few years, couples who are both single children have been allowed the option of having a second child. The latest change will give couples the option of having two children if just one of the parents is an only child.\nSimilarly, Chinese President Xi Jinping vowed to abolish the much-hated \"re-education through labour\" system when he first came to power. Quietly, officials have been winding down the system over the past few months.\nThe Communist government is not prone to making rash decisions. In order to gain the consensus it needs to carry out its plans at the local level, officials need to announce them well ahead of time. Surprises aren't popular in China, it seems.\nThe BBC's Celia Hatton, in Beijing, says most of the changes have already been tested in parts of the country.\nOfficials announce their plans well in advance to gain the consensus they need, she adds.\nThe latest announcements are contained in a 22,000-word document released three days after the Third Plenum meeting of the Communist leadership in Beijing.\nTraditionally reforms are expected from the Third Plenum, because new leaders are seen as having had time to consolidate power. President Xi Jinping took office last year.\nThe one-child policy would be \"adjusted and improved step by step to promote 'long-term balanced development of the population in China'\", Xinhua said.\nChina introduced its one-child policy at the end of the 1970s to curb rapid population growth.\nBut correspondents say the policy has become increasingly unpopular and that leaders fear the country's ageing population will both reduce the labour pool and exacerbate elderly care issues.\nBy 2050, more than a quarter of the population will be over 65.\nThe one-child policy has on the whole been strictly enforced, though some exceptions already exist, including for ethnic minorities.\nIn some cities, both parents must be only children in order to be allowed to have a second child.\nChinese netizens hail one-child-policy move\nIn the countryside, families are allowed to have two children if the first is a girl.\nCouples who flout the rules can face heavy fines, or possibly lose their property or their jobs.\nRights groups say the law has meant some women being coerced into abortions, which Beijing denies.\nThe traditional preference for boys has also created a gender imbalance as some couples opt for sex-selective abortions.\nBy the end of the decade, demographers say China will have 24 million \"leftover men\" who, because of China's gender imbalance, will not be able to find a wife.\nMost of the elderly in China are still cared for by relatives, and only children from single-child parents face what is known as the 4-2-1 phenomenon.\nWhen the child reaches working age, he or she could have to care for two parents and four grandparents in retirement.\nOn Tuesday, when the Third Plenum ended, China's leaders also promised that the free market would play a bigger role, and farmers would have greater property rights over their land.\nBy 2050 more than a quarter of China's population will be over 65 years old and younger generations face an unprecedented burden of care.\nAgeing China: Changes and challenges\nState firms will be required to pay larger dividends to the government, while private firms will be given a greater role in the economy.\nThere will be greater liberalisation in both interest rates and the free convertibility of the yuan. More overseas investment will be allowed.\nThere will also be an increase in the number of smaller banks and financial institutions funded by private capital.\nXinhua said the decision to do away with the \"re-education through labour\" camps was \"part of efforts to improve human rights and judicial practices\".\nChina's leaders had previously said they wanted to reform the system.\nThe network of camps created half a century ago holds tens of thousands of inmates.\nPolice panels have the power to sentence offenders to years in camps without trial.\nOther reforms announced on Friday include a reduction in the number of crimes subject to the death penalty.","LLM_1":"As the Communist party continues to navigate the complexities of China's rapidly evolving society, experts predict that these reforms will have far-reaching consequences for families, businesses,  and the nation as whole. \"This is a significant shift in policy, one that acknowledges the changing needs and desires of Chinese citizens,\" said Dr. Sophia Chen, a leading demographer at the prestigious Tsinghua University.\n\nThe decision to allow couples with one only-child parent to have two offspring is expected to be particularly popular in rural areas, where family sizes have historically been larger. According to official data, approximately 30% of rural couples have only one child due to various economic and social factors. This change is likely to alleviate some of  the pressure on China's aging population, which is projected to peak in 2035, when the number of elderly citizens is forecast to surpass the working-age population.\n\nMeanwhile, abolition  of re- education through labor camps marks a major turning point in China's efforts to reform its notorious human rights record. These facilities have long been criticized by international human  rights organizations for their use of forced labor and other forms of mistreatment. While estimates vary, it is believed that thousands of people have passed through these camps since their inception in Mao' s era.\n\nIn a bid to further boost economic growth, China is set to implement a range of measures aimed at increasing the influence of private enterprise. Among the planned reforms is the easing of restrictions on foreign investment, allowing multinational corporations to take greater stakes in Chinese companies. Additionally, government subsidies will become more readily available to small and medium-sized businesses. Economists predict this could lead to a surge in innovation and entrepreneurship, driving China towards a more market-oriented economy.\n\nWhile the government has not provided a clear timeline for these developments, insiders indicate that many of them will begin to materialize over  coming months. As China continues its journey towards greater economic, social,   and political openness, observers will closely watch the implementation of this ambitious agenda. Will these  reforms prove a step in right direction for China or merely a tactical maneuver? Only time will tell. In the meantime, as the world watches, this vast and complex nation continues  to evolve, ever-changing, yet forever fascinating.  With these recent changes, we are witnessing the dawn of an exciting new era for a nation that has long fascinated the global community. With a population of over a billion and a half people, any shift  in this nation''   s trajectory is bound to capture attention, making these ongoing developments an unmissable story. China watchers will eagerly await the implications of what promises to  be an extraordinary chapter in its history.    The world is holding its breath as China embarks on this  journey of reform. One thing is certain: the impact will extend far beyond the shores of its vast territories.   For a country that'    s always walked its own path, change comes naturally. But this time, with such a wide-reaching agenda, all eyes are on Beijing. How will the rest of us be affected?","LLM_2":"China Embarks On Far-Reaching Reforms Amid Global Attention\n\nThe Communist Party's latest moves are expectedto have significant consequencesfor families and businesses nationwide.

{"human":"Forgive my odd combination of prose and script. I could n't make it work any other way. \n \n Scene: Behind closed doors, George and Lorraine's bedroom. \n \n Lorraine: Oh God, George. Not this again. I thought we'd already resolved this? \n \n George: I'm telling you, Lorraine; the resemblance is uncanny! Every year, Marty looks more and more like Calvin. Look. ( Opens up yearbook. ) This is the picture that was taken of him at the dance. It's not a great picture, but the similarities are undeniable! \n \n Lorraine: But I have n't even seen him since the dance. I'm not even sure he's alive any more. I mean, after he went missing, we looked for him. His uncle would n't even say anything. \n \n George: I do n't know that; it's entirely possible you ran into him years later. Look. ( George takes her hands in his, looks into her eyes. ) I'm not even worried about it. It's obvious both Dave and Linda are mine. I'm not going to freak out about this. I just do n't want to be lied to, not by you. So please, just tell me what happened. \n \n Lorraine: ( Looks away. ) George, I know. I would tell you. And had I run into him years ago, I would have told you about it, brought him over for dinner or something. He was your friend too. I would tell you... but it's just not true. \n \n George: ( Runs his hands through his hair ) It just does n't make any sense. How could there be such an extraordinary resemblance without some kind of a genetic connection. I mean, Marty's practically a clone... and I know I write about things like that, but this is real life! Lorraine, I want to believe you... \n \n Lorraine: Then do! George, I'm beginning to get the impression you do n't trust me. \n \n George: I worry. I know how Biff feels about you, and if you've already hidden something like this once... \n \n Lorraine: George! I would never! \n \n *** \n \n Marty McFly hears voices from down the hall, the sound of his parents arguing. It's not something they do often, so it worries him. He creeps down the hall, stands near enough to the door to be able to hear the words. From inside, he hears George shout, `` Why do n't you just admit it! You ran into him, you slept with him, you were ashamed, and that's why you did n't tell me about it!'' \n \n Lorraine replies, `` And I'm telling you that never happened! It would be too weird! Yes, I was in love with Calvin at the time, but that kiss felt almost incestuous! Why would I suddenly jump into bed with him on a whim?'' \n \n George retorts, `` Why, indeed.'' \n \n Marty, his eyes bulging, made his way back to his room, to consider how to handle the situation. \n \n *** \n \n This next part is n't as fun to write, but I think Marty and Jennifer ultimately pull George aside and tell him what happened. No worries about George breaking the masquerade, since if he did start talking about time travel, people would just assume he's talking about the plot for his next book. George is extremely skeptical at first, but then Dr. Brown's time travel train appears out of nowhere... thus proving that Marty is telling the truth. \n \n When Marty asks the Doc how he knew to show up when and where he did, Doc will tell him it's because he's about to write a letter and have it sent to a particular place at a particular time, where Doc will get it and come back to this moment. He sternly warns Marty that he must do this to avoid a temporal paradox.\n","LLM_1":"him losing the boy, Lorraine. I\u2019m worried about *you*. You\u2019ve been so distant since the reunion.

{"human":"The University of Notre Dame has made being a sustainability leader an integral part of its mission, creating the Office of Sustainability in 2008 to achieve a number of goals in the areas of power generation, design and construction, waste reduction, procurement, food services, transportation, and water.As of 2012[update] four building construction projects were pursuing LEED-Certified status and three were pursuing LEED Silver. Notre Dame's dining services sources 40% of its food locally and offers sustainably caught seafood as well as many organic, fair-trade, and vegan options. On the Sustainable Endowments Institute's College Sustainability Report Card 2010, University of Notre Dame received a \"B\" grade. The university also houses the Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies. Father Gustavo Gutierrez, the founder of Liberation Theology is a current faculty member.","LLM_1":"To further achieve its sustainability goals, the University's Office for Research and Economic Development collaborated with faculty, staff, students, local businesses, community organizations, government agencies, to create the Notre dame Climate Change Research Initiative (NDCCRI). The NDCCRi was established to advance research and education on climate change, its impacts, mitigation, adaptation, equity, justice, human rights, health, sustainable development, social, economic, environmental, political, legal, technological, agricultural, natural resource, energy, water, ocean, forest, land-use, biodiversity, ecosystem, food, security, policy, law, ethics, governance, risk, decision-making, culture, history, philosophy, theology, art, music, literature, drama, dance, visual arts, architecture, engineering, science, technology, innovation, entrepreneurship, international relations, trade, commerce, finance, economics, public administration, education, research, outreach, extension, service, engagement, development.\n\nThe initiative aimed to build a comprehensive understanding of climate-related challenges and opportunities, with a focus on developing and applying solutions that promote the well-being of people and the planet. This included fostering partnerships among academic departments, institutes, centers, schools, colleges, faculties, researchers, scholars, experts, practitioners, policymakers, stakeholders, communities, organizations. Through collaborative research projects, workshops, conferences, lectures, seminars, courses, training programs, fellowships, grants, awards, recognition, visibility, reputation, credibility, impact, influence, leadership, expertise, capacity, resources, infrastructure, facilities, equipment, funding, support, ND CCRI facilitated a culture of innovation and discovery, driving solutions to climate challenges. By engaging with diverse perspectives and expertise from across the globe, Notre Dam's CCri fostered global citizenship, understanding, cooperation, collaboration, mutual respect, tolerance, empathy, compassion, kindness, generosity, inclusivity, diversity, accessibility, equality, fairness, transparency, accountability, responsibility, sustainability, resilience, adaptability, flexibility, agility, creativity, resourcefulness, problem-solving, critical thinking, analytical reasoning, evidence-based decision making, open-mindedness, curiosity, lifelong learning, intellectual freedom, academic freedom. In 2013, this initiative led to Notre dam becoming the first university in United States to commit to carbon neutrality by 2050.  By  2030 the campus was aiming to be 100% renewable. With this ambitious goal in sight, The University continued to work towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions, increasing energy efficiency, promoting renewable energy sources, conserving water resources and promoting sustainable transportation. These efforts were guided by the principles of sustainability: environmental stewardship,  social responsibility and economic viability. As a result, in just a few years, it had become a model for other institutions to follow. Its success was widely recognized, as evidenced by numerous awards and accolades from organizations like the Association for the Advancement of Sustainable Higher Education, Second Nature, Sustainability Tracking, Assessment & Rating System, Climate Action Plan, President's Climate Leadership Awards, Higher and Continuing Education Sustainability Awards. Thus, at the end of  the 10-year period, these achievements set the stage for a new era of commitment to sustainability and climate action. However, many challenges remained, including climate policy debates, stakeholder engagement and institutional capacity building. Despite these challenges, one thing was clear: the importance of continued collaboration and commitment was crucial for making progress. Consequently, a  new  office was created, called the office of Climate action and sustainability. One of key roles of this office is  to help the university achieve  its goal of net zero carbon emissions by mid century. To achieve this goal, we will continue to develop and implement  strategies and initiatives in several areas, such as: energy management, transportation, waste reduction and recycling, buildings and grounds, purchasing, supply chain, academics and research. A new goal was set to reduce the greenhouse gases by half within a decade. We will also focus  on promoting  research  and  education  in climate  change. Furthermore, an advisory committee was formed to oversee and guide the efforts in reducing the carbon footprint. So as the years passed, people began to take notice of what was happening at Notre dames and other universities. They realized that they too could make a difference by taking action on their own campuses. And so, slowly but surely, other campuses began adopting similar initiatives, until finally, there was a national movement underway to make the United states carbon neutral. At the heart of it all was the determination of one small university to do its part in addressing the biggest challenge of our time. But it was not without its challenges that this journey was undertaken. There were many who doubted the feasibility of such a goal. Some argued that it would be too costly, others that technology was still in its infancy, while others felt that climate was too far away. Yet the team at University  persevered. Because they believed that there were more benefits than costs, they decided to press on. Now, looking back on that decade, what can we see?","LLM_2":"**Notre Dame Takes a Leap Towards Sustainability**\n\nIn a groundbreaking effort to achieve sustainability excellence, University officials collaborated closely with students and staff to establish the Climate Research Initative (CRI), a pioneering program that aimed at fostering innovative solutions for mitigating climate impacts. Building a robust understanding through collaborative projects and partnerships, CRI created an ecosystem of experts and stakeholders from various disciplines to address pressing climate issues.\n\nAt the forefront of CRIA's mission was developing effective solutions tailored to promoting human well being and environmental sustainability worldwide. Fostering partnerships across departments and institutions helped create a vibrant culture that thrived on innovation. Cria's engagement with global perspectives facilitated global understanding and cooperation.\n\nBy 2003 the institution achieved a significant milestone by committing to become the country's first carbon-neutral university by '2055. Moreover, by implementing a '2035 renewable plan, campus sustainability efforts focused on reducing energy consumption, incorporating renewable resources like solar and wind power, conservation of water sources and enhancing eco-friendly transportation methods. Guided by sustainability principles, i.e., environmental protection, societal responsibility. and financial viability, university officials aimed for setting a benchmark for sustainable practices.\n\nAs a testament to their commitment, several prestigious awards from esteemed organizations acknowledged the institutions' outstanding performance. Following this exemplary model, numerous institutions began integrating similar sustainability initiatives into their campus operations.\n\nA decade later, climate policies, inclusive of stake holder engagement as well as building institutional capacities became essential components. Therefore, establishing the Office of Sustainability and Climate led by a team of dedicated professionals aimed towards developing more effective strategies to further reduce carbon footprints and create new opportunities for advancing climate education.\n\nKey objectives of these new strategies included implementing more efficient energy systems, developing transportation options, enhancing waste recycling and purchasing processes, fostering academic and reseach collaborations to improve climate resilience. Notably, setting new goals for reducing emissions and forming advisory committees to monitor progress have been key drivers in Notre Dame's ongoing commitment towards sustainability.\n\nNotably the movement towards a carbon-free campus is not just an isolated event, rather it has sparked a nationwide movement to promote a clean environment. It has inspired institutions across America to prioritize sustainability by adopting their very own initiatives. Ultimately this inspiring story serves as a powerful reminder of how even a small commitment can lead to bigger changes and pave the way for more inclusive and environmentally conscious communities. \n\nThe Notre Dames example, however, highlights the challenges faced by many in the early stages of implementing sustainable solutions. Critics questioned the cost, feasibility, or effectiveness of some of their plans. Nonetheless, through perseverance and a commitment that outweighed the costs and doubts, their efforts paid off in creating a thriving model that has the potential to inspire change across communities nationwide. Today, when looking at that transformative journey, you see a story of resilience and collaboration that shows us that even the smallest steps can make all the difference. That the commitment of individuals can bring about change and inspire others to join in. Most importantly, that we all have the power to shape a brighter future for generations to come..","op1":"create","op2":"rewrite","domain":"squad","model":"llama"}

{"human":"While the crowds shuffled out of Madison Square Garden, Taylor Swift sat alone in her dressing room and began to wipe away her makeup. With the damp cloth pressed against her face, she began to feel more like herself again. As every piece of this false exterior shed away, the mascara, the contacts, the wig, she remembered who she was. Who she is. \n \n She set down the foundation covered rag and looked proudly into the mirror. \u201c My name is Samya, \u201d she said aloud, as if to make sure she never again forgot. She looked deeply into her eyes for what seemed to be an eternity, at her beautiful arabic features, glad to be free of the facade she is forced to portray. \n \n A knock came at the door. \u201c I asked not to be disturbed! \u201d Samya uncharacteristically shouted. \n \n \u201c Don \u2019 t worry, I know. It \u2019 s me, John. Let me in, Taylor, \u201d gently spoke John Mayer through the door. Samya slow rose to her feet and let John in, keeping herself hidden from view as to not let any one passing by see her true self. \n \n \u201c What are you doing?! \u201d John disapprovingly said. \u201c You know that if any person comes in and sees you, this game is over. \u201d \n \n \u201c Oh please, Hassan \u201d Samya said, referring to his true name. \u201c Anyone that saw me in here would have no idea who I am.

The purpose of this study was to compare dose-volume characteristics with the brachial plexus between treatment plans generated by IMRT and CRT using several common treatment scenarios.The brachial plexus was delineated on radiation treatment planning CT scans from 10 patients undergoing IMRT for locally advanced head and neck cancer using a Radiation Therapy Oncology Group-endorsed atlas. No brachial plexus constraint was used. For each patient, a conventional three-field shrinking-field plan was generated and the dose-volume histogram (DVH) for the brachial plexus was compared with that of the IMRT plan.The mean irradiated volumes of the brachial plexus using the IMRT vs the CRT plan, respectively, were as follows: V50 (18\u00b15 ml) vs (11\u00b16 ml), p = 0.01; V60 (6\u00b14 ml) vs (3\u00b13 ml), p = 0.02; V66 (3\u00b11 ml) vs (1\u00b11 ml), p = 0.04, V70 (0\u00b11 ml) vs (0\u00b11 ml), p = 0.68. The maximum point dose to the brachial plexus was 68.9 Gy (range 62.3-78.7 Gy) and 66.1 Gy (range 60.2-75.6 Gy) for the IMRT and CRT plans, respectively (p = 0.01).","LLM_1":"the two treatment modalities.

Statistical comparisons were performed using Mann-Whitney U tests to evaluate differences in dose distributions. \n\nPreliminary results indicated that IMRT significantly reduced the Dmax and Dmean to the brachial plexus compared to CRT. Additionally, lower percentages of the brachial plexus volume receiving doses above 30 Gy were observed in the IMRT cohort, suggesting a potential reduction in the risk of radiation-induced neuropathy. These findings underscore the importance of treatment planning techniques that minimize exposure to critical structures, thereby enhancing the therapeutic ratio in head and neck cancer management.

{"human":"Coronary heart disease (CHD) is a frequent medical condition in developed countries and is one of the most serious diseases threatening patients' lives. Perioperative myocardial infarction is the major cause of perioperative cardiac death and cardiac arrest, but is difficult to be precisely identified by observing clinical symptoms or assessing cardiac enzyme levels or by ECG examination. Therefore, assessment of patient prognosis requires reliable predictors. In this regard, we tested the prognostic value of serum troponin I (TnI) concentrations.98 patients undergoing elective simple off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting were recruited. Venous blood samples were collected within 3-5 hours, 18-24 hours, and 36-48 hours post-operation, and associations of TnI concentrations with early outcomes measures (duration of assisted ventilation, length of stay in the ICU, length of postoperative stay, administration of antihypotensive medications, use of intra-aortic balloon pump, and ECG abnormalities) were evaluated. Correlations of postoperative TnI concentrations with the outcomes measures were analyzed by using median TnI concentrations as the cut-off value.TnI concentrations assessed within 18-24 hours post-operation showed significant associations with most tested outcome measures (p < 0.05 for four out of five comparisons). Furthermore, after building ROC curves, the highest AUC values (> 0.9) were also observed for TnI1 concentrations assessed within this time frame. The optimal cutoff value for TnI concentration was 1.78 ng\/ml.","LLM_1":"due to overlapping biomarkers and nonspecific electrocardiographic changes in surgical settings.

{"human":"This paper proposes an approach to neural MT in which the joint (source, target) distribution is modeled as an average over two different factorizations: target given source and source given target. This gives rise to four distributions - two language models and two translation models - which are parameterized separately but conditioned on a common variational latent variable. The model is trained on parallel data using a standard VAE approach. It can additionally be trained on non-parallel data in an approach similar to iterated back-translation at sentence-level granularity, but with language and translation model probabilities for observed sentences coupled by the latent variable. Inference iterates between sampling a latent variable given the current best hypothesis, and using beam search plus rescoring to find a new best hypothesis given the current latent variable. The approach is evaluated in several different scenarios (low- and high-resource, domain adaptation - trained on parallel data only or parallel plus monolingual data) and found to generally outperform previous work on generative NMT and iterated back-translation.\n\nStrengths: clearly written, well motivated, very comprehensive experiments comparing to relevant baselines.\n\nWeaknesses: somewhat incremental relative to Shah and Barber (Neurips 2018), results are only marginally positive, framework is probably too cumbersome to justify widespread adoption based on the results.\n\nI think the paper should be accepted. Although it\u2019s not highly original, it ties together three strands of work in a principled way: joint models, variational approaches, and back-translation \/ dual learning. The increment over Shah and Barber is bolstered by the addition of back-translation, which gives substantial improvements when using non-parallel data; and to a lesser extent by the argument about the advantage of separate models for distant language pairs. Using all possible LMs and TMs coupled with a latent variable feels like an area that was inevitably going to get explored, and this paper does a good job of it. Although the gains over the baselines are not overly compelling, they are quite systematic, indicating that the advantage is probably real, albeit slight. The authors are also to be commended on their use of not just the Shah and Barber baseline, but also the back-translation-based techniques, which are generally stronger competitors when monolingual data is incorporated.\n\nFurther comments\/questions:\n\nWhy are there no results for Transformer+Dual in table 4? This omission looks odd, since Transformer+Dual was the strongest baseline in table 3.\n\nPlease add implementation details for the Transformer+{BT,JBT,Dual} baselines.\n\nIt was surprising not to see robustness experiments like Shah and Barber\u2019s dropped source words, since robustness to source noise could be one of the advantages of having an explicit model of the source sentence.\n\nA few additional suggestions for related work: noisy channel approaches (eg, The Neural Noisy Channel, Yu et al, ICLR 2017); decipherment (eg, Beyond parallel data: Joint word alignment and decipherment improves machine translation, EMNLP 2014 - yes, from SMT days, but still); other joint modeling work (KERMIT: Generative Insertion-Based Modeling for Sequences, Chan et al, 2019).\n\nConsider dropping the \u201c1+1 > 2\u201d metaphor. It\u2019s not clear to me exactly what it means, or what it adds to the paper.\n\n\u201cdeviation\u201d is used in a couple places where you probably meant \u201cderivation\u201d?\n\nLine 6 in algorithm 2 should use both forward and backward scores for rescoring.","LLM_1":"By symmetrically modeling both source-to-target and target-to-source conditionals under a shared latent space, the method introduces a form of implicit consistency regularization that may contribute to improved generalization, particularly in low-resource settings. This design choice is theoretically well-motivated and aligns with recent trends in leveraging dual learning principles for sequence transduction tasks.\n\n- One notable strength lies in the model\u2019s ability to exploit monolingual data through a mechanism that couples language modeling and translation components via the latent variable. Unlike standard back-translation, which treats synthetic translations as ground truth, this approach maintains probabilistic coherence by preserving the joint distribution structure during training on unpaired sentences. This could lead to more robust updates when incorporating noisy or imperfectly generated data, potentially mitigating error propagation commonly observed in iterative methods.\n\n- The inference procedure\u2014alternating between latent variable sampling and hypothesis refinement via beam search and rescoring\u2014introduces an interesting dynamic between latent representation and output generation. This iterative decoding strategy resembles expectation-maximization-style optimization over the latent space and may allow the model to escape poor local modes in the output distribution. However, it also raises questions about computational efficiency and convergence behavior during inference, especially when compared to standard single-pass autoregressive decoding.\n\n- A critical aspect requiring further clarification is the extent to which the two translation models (source\u2192target and target\u2192source) share parameters or architectural components. While the paper emphasizes separate parameterization, any degree of weight sharing or architectural symmetry between these components could significantly influence both performance and training dynamics. A detailed ablation on parameter sharing configurations would strengthen the empirical analysis.\n\n- The use of a common variational latent variable to tie together four distinct distributions introduces a high-dimensional bottleneck that may affect representational capacity. It would be informative to examine how the dimensionality of the latent space impacts translation quality, particularly in terms of fluency versus adequacy. Additionally, sensitivity analyses on the choice of prior (e.g., isotropic Gaussian vs. more flexible priors) and the impact of KL regularization strength could provide deeper insights into the trade-offs involved in latent-variable modeling for MT.\n\n- While the training objective appears to follow standard evidence lower bound (ELBO) maximization, the precise formulation of the multi-component loss function\u2014especially how the parallel and non-parallel data contributions are balanced\u2014deserves more explicit treatment. In particular, the weighting scheme between supervised and unsupervised objectives may have a substantial effect on convergence and final performance, especially when monolingual data vastly outnumbers parallel examples.\n\n- Empirical evaluation should include comparisons against strong baselines such as dual supervised training, knowledge distillation from ensembles, and other latent-variable-based MT models like VAE-MT or aligned variational autoencoders. Without such comparisons, it is difficult to assess whether the improvements stem specifically from the proposed architecture or simply from effective use of additional data and training signals.\n\n- The paper would benefit from a qualitative analysis of the latent space, including visualization of latent representations across different sentence pairs or examination of how posterior samples influence translation hypotheses. Such analysis could reveal whether the latent variable captures meaningful semantic or syntactic alignments, discourse-level features, or other abstract properties beyond simple word-level correspondences.\n\n- An important practical consideration is the scalability of the method to larger datasets and multilingual scenarios. Given that the model relies on coordinated updates across multiple components and latent variables, its training stability and memory footprint on large-scale corpora remain open questions. Evaluation on diverse language pairs with varying typological divergence would help establish the generality of the approach.\n\n- The current description lacks details regarding initialization strategies for the latent variables and how posterior collapse\u2014a known issue in VAEs applied to sequence modeling\u2014is mitigated. Techniques such as KL annealing, auxiliary losses, or modified inference networks are commonly employed in related work; specifying whether such measures are used and their effectiveness in this setup is essential for reproducibility.\n\n- From a modeling perspective, it would be valuable to explore whether the averaging over factorizations can be generalized beyond equal weighting. Learning a mixture coefficient dynamically\u2014either globally or at the instance level\u2014might allow the model to adaptively favor one direction based on input characteristics, potentially improving robustness in asymmetric translation scenarios (e.g., morphologically rich to analytic languages).\n\n- The interaction between beam search and latent sampling during inference warrants further investigation. Specifically, the number of iterations, sampling variance, and criteria for termination could all influence final output quality. Providing ablation studies on these hyperparameters would clarify the reliability and sensitivity of the decoding process.\n\n- Although the method is framed within the VAE paradigm, the reliance on reparameterized gradients assumes continuous latent variables. Exploring discrete latent structures\u2014perhaps using Gumbel-Softmax relaxation or hybrid discrete-continuous spaces\u2014could offer complementary advantages in capturing categorical linguistic phenomena such as tense, register, or domain shifts.\n\n- The potential for transfer learning or domain adaptation via the latent space remains underexplored. If the latent variable encodes cross-lingual meaning independently of surface form, then it might serve as a basis for zero-shot translation or adaptation to new domains with limited supervision. Even preliminary experiments in this direction would enhance the paper\u2019s impact.\n\n- Error analysis should go beyond BLEU scores to examine specific failure modes. For instance, does the model reduce hallucination or inconsistency in named entities and quantities due to the dual consistency constraints? Are there measurable improvements in rare word translation or handling of long-range dependencies compared to baseline systems?\n\n- Another area for expansion involves the treatment of uncertainty quantification. Since the model produces a distribution over latent variables and outputs, it may naturally support confidence estimation for translation candidates. Demonstrating calibrated uncertainty scores or applications in human-in-the-loop translation could broaden the method\u2019s applicability.\n\n- The paper would gain depth by situating its contributions relative to prior work on joint distribution modeling in MT, such as IBM Model 2's symmetry assumptions or more recent efforts like CMLM (Conditional Masked Language Modeling) and EMU. Clarifying what distinguishes the current formulation\u2014beyond the use of variational inference\u2014would sharpen the technical narrative.\n\n- Training stability across different stages (supervised, semi-supervised, iterative refinement) should be documented. For example, do the language models dominate early training phases, delaying useful signal for translation components? Monitoring component-wise gradient magnitudes or loss trajectories could illuminate such dynamics.\n\n- The role of the latent variable in enabling cross-modal alignment\u2014should the framework be extended to multimodal MT\u2014could be briefly discussed as a forward-looking remark. Its current design already supports structured coupling between modalities through shared latent structure, making it a promising candidate for future extensions.\n\n- Implementation details such as optimization schedules, batch construction strategies (e.g., mixing parallel and monolingual batches), and gradient clipping practices should be clearly reported. These factors often critically affect performance in complex multi-objective setups and are necessary for replication.\n\n- Consideration should be given to whether the gains attributed to the model architecture persist under stronger pretraining baselines, such as those initialized from large multilingual encoders (e.g., mBART, M2M-100). Demonstrating improvement over such strong starting points would underscore the added value of the proposed approach.\n\n- The paper could benefit from analyzing the correlation between reconstruction accuracy in both directions and final translation performance. High fidelity in reverse translation (target \u2192 source) might indicate better semantic preservation, and measuring this link could validate the core assumption underlying the dual modeling strategy.\n\n- Runtime profiling of the training and inference pipelines is recommended. Given the increased complexity from multiple models and iterative decoding, understanding throughput and latency implications is crucial for real-world deployment considerations.\n\n- Finally, while the conceptual framework is compelling, ensuring sufficient empirical rigor through statistical significance testing, multiple random seeds, and diverse test sets will be key to establishing credibility. Small improvements on standard benchmarks can sometimes vanish under tighter experimental control, so robust validation is essential.","LLM_2":"preserving the original meaning and technical depth while enhancing clarity, fluency, and stylistic appropriateness for an academic review context.

{"human":"Visual Restorative function training aims to decrease visual field defect size after acquired brain damage. Some chronic stroke patients regain permission to drive a car after training. This points to a concomitant change in oculomotor behavior, because visual field enlargement is hardly ever large enough for legal driving. This study investigated vRFT-induced changes in oculomotor behavior, using a driving simulator.Driving performance and oculomotor behavior were measured before and after training in 6 hemianopia patients who had trained 65 hours with vRFT on a PC at home.Two patients showed negligible visual field enlargement (VFE) and four showed moderate to substantial VFE. Because less visual cortex is devoted to the processing of peripheral than central visual field the same VFE corresponds to less functional restoration of cortex when the defect is at high eccentricity. When this is taken into account, then precisely the two patients that showed the largest cortical gains made significantly more eye movements in the direction of their visual field defect after training.","LLM_1":"Our research group has been investigating the efficacy of visual restorative training in enhancing oculo-motor functions among chronic brain-injured patients. Notably, preliminary findings suggest a significant correlation between improvements in visual perception and adaptive changes in eye movement patterns. To elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying this phenomenon, we employed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine alterations in brain activity associated with visual processing and oculate behavior in patients undergoing restoratory training.\n\nWe recruited 20 patients with chronic visual-field defects resulting from acquired cerebral damage and randomly assigned them to either a visual-restorative-training group (n = 10) or a control group. Participants in the training group underwent 6 weeks of intensive visual therapy, consisting of computerized visual-perception tasks and eye-movement exercises. Pre- and post-training fMRI scans were obtained while participants performed a standardized visual task, which involved detecting and tracking moving targets in their visual periphery.\n\nOur results indicate that patients in both groups exhibited significant changes from pre- to post-intervention in various brain regions, including the occipital, parietal, frontal, cingulate, thalamic, basal ganglia, brainstem, limbic system, cerebellar, etc. In the visual restoration training cohort, notable increases in activity were observed in areas linked to attention, executive function, motor planning, spatial perception, visual-spatial working memory, eye movements, error detection, reward processing, salience detection and processing of social stimuli.\n\nThe observed changes were accompanied by a notable improvement in performance on visual tasks, particularly in detecting targets within their peripheral visual fields. Moreover, a subset of patients demonstrated a marked reduction in size of their initial visual defects, with some even regaining driving privileges. These findings provide compelling evidence for the therapeutic potential of targeted visual training programs in mitigating the consequences of acquired visual impairments. However, further investigation is needed to elucidated the causal relationships between brain changes and visual function improvements. Future studies should also explore the generalizability of these results to diverse patient populations and examine the effects of varying training protocols on neural plasticity. \n\nThese observations have significant implications for rehabilitation strategies in neurology and may also shed light on fundamental processes of neuroplasticity and cognitive development. Hence, the present study contributes to our understanding of how visual experience can shape and reshape the brain's function and structure, opening avenues for novel therapeutic approaches in treating visual and motor disorders. Further research should aim to clarify the precise mechanisms through which visual experiences exert their effects on brain development and function. By doing so, researchers can better understand the complex interplay between vision, cognition, emotion, attention and behavior. Thus, future studies may provide new insights into how to tailor interventions to meet the unique needs of individuals with acquired and congenital visual deficits. Ultimately, this research holds promise for improving the lives of millions of people affected by visual disorders worldwide.","LLM_2":"Our investigation has focused on the effectiveness of visually restitutive training (VRT) in augmenting oculomotor capabilities in chronic cerebral-injury patients, who often exhibit compromised visual functions. Preliminary findings have revealed a substantial correlation among improvements observed within visual perceptual domains and corresponding adaptations in ocular motor patterns.\n\nTo elucidation the underlying neural substrates mediating this association, functional neuroimaging (functional magnetic-resonance imaging, fMri) was employed to investigate modifications in cerebral activity related to visual information processing in individuals undergoing VRT. Specifically, alterations associated within the visuomotion process and oculation behavior were examined.\n\nTwenty patients afflicted with persistent visual field deficits resulting due to acquired brain damage were recruited. Following random assignment to one of two groups, either the VTRT group consisting (N=10), or the control cohort (also consisting, n=  1), participants in VRTC underwent six weeks long, intensive VPT sessions. Sessions included computer-based visual cognition exercises and gaze training. Prior to and following the intervention period, high-resolution fMR images were collected while patients performed standardized tasks assessing their ability to detect and track moving stimuli in peripheral vision.\n\nFindings from this study indicate notable, group-wise alterations observed across various cerebral regions in response to intervention.  These regions included the cerebral cortex, caudate, pallidum, amygdala, hippocampus, substantia nigra, red nucleus, superior colliculus, anterior commissure, ventral tegmental area, periaqueductal gray, prefrontal cortex etc.\n\nIn the cohort receiving VrT, significant increases were noted in regions linked with attentional processes, decision-making, working-memory functions, saccadic eye motion, movement planning and coordination, vision-based attention modulation, ophthalmic motor control, occlusion perception etc, amongst others.\n\nThese changes correlated with improved task performance, especially in identifying moving objects within peripheral fields of view. Furthermore, subset analyses revealed notable reductions in initial deficits, some patients regained the ability for unrestricted visual activities, like driving. The results of this investigation indicate significant evidence of therapeutic efficacy for targeted VTP interventions in reducing the impact of vision impairing brain injuries.\n\nHowever, additional research is required to determine the mechanistic relationships linking changes observed at the level of brain structure and brain function to vision improvement. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct future research examining the applicability and generalisability these findings in diverse populations of afflicted individuals and in determining the effect of varied training regimens on cerebral neuro adaptability.\n\nThis study has significant outcomes for neurorehabilitation strategies, offering valuable insights to research on neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative processes. It highlights the profound effects that visual stimulation can have on shaping the function of cerebral tissue, thus providing avenues to new therapeutic methods for treating vision and movement disorders.\n\nFuture studies are recommended to further elucidating precise neural pathways that mediate effects exerted by vision on cognitive functions and neural development processes in humans. Additionally, research into the interrelationship between these processes may offer new avenues of understanding the relationship between attention processes and behavioral processes.\n\nThus, by doing this, investigators can gain a better understanding in how vision plays a role in cognition and emotion processes that are complex in nature, facilitating new discoveries that may lead to developing interventions that meet unique requirements of those afflicted by congenitally or acquired vision deficits.\n\nTherefore, our investigation offers promise in improving quality of life for millions worldwide who are affected due visual related impairances. \nNote: I made some changes to improve the readability and flow of your text while maintaining the original content and meaning.

{"human":"Umbilical cord blood (UCB) is a source of stem cells used for allogeneic transplantation, in addition to bone marrow and peripheral blood. Limited numbers of stem cells in a single UCB unit is associated with slow haematopoietic recovery and high risk of graft failure, particularly in adult patients. UCB stem cells can be expanded ex vivo; however, rapid differentiation reduces their regenerative potential. We have recently shown that Wnt\/\u03b2-catenin signalling is down-regulated in ex vivo-expanded stem cells; therefore, we propose that re-activation of Wnt signalling using GSK-3\u03b2 inhibition may act to improve regenerative potential of these ex vivo-expanded stem cells.Immunocompromised mice were employed in transplantation studies to determine stem-cell engraftment. Flow cytometry was used to phenotype the engrafted human cells. Retroviral gene transfer was used to examine the role of Myc gene up-regulated by GSK-3\u03b2 inhibition, in ex vivo-expanded stem cells.Treatment with GSK-3\u03b2 inhibitor, 6-bromoindirubin 3'-oxime (BIO) improved early human cell engraftment in the mice and elevated the numbers of myeloid progenitor cells in cytokine-stimulated culture. BIO up-regulated \u03b2-catenin and c-myc in ex vivo-expanded stem cells. Ectopic expression of Myc acted to increase clonogenic potential and to delay differentiation of haematopoietic progenitor cells, suggesting the potential mechanism to improve regenerative potential of ex vivo-expanded grafts.","LLM_1":"expansion techniques often yield heterogeneous cell populations, complicating their clinical applicability. Recent advances in bioreactor technologies and optimized culture conditions have shown promise in enhancing the yield and functionality of UCB-derived stem cells. These methodologies aim to maintain a balance between self-renewal and differentiation, thus preserving the stem cell characteristics while promoting sufficient expansion rates.\n\nMoreover, the incorporation of specific growth factors and cytokines has been investigated to improve the hematopoietic potential of expanded UCB stem cells. Studies have indicated that the use of feeder layers and extracellular matrix components can further enhance cell proliferation and maintain lineage-specific differentiation capabilities. \n\nIn parallel, ongoing research into the genetic and epigenetic modulation of these cells may provide insights into overcoming the limitations associated with UCB transplantations. This approach could facilitate the development of personalized therapies that optimize engraftment and enhance patient outcomes. Collectively, these strategies hold the potential to transform UCB into a more viable option for treating hematological malignancies in adult populations, addressing the critical issue of cell availability and function in transplantation settings.","LLM_2":"The utilization of expansion techniques frequently results in heterogeneous populations of cells, which poses challenges for their clinical implementation.

{"human":"The College of Arts and Letters was established as the university's first college in 1842 with the first degrees given in 1849. The university's first academic curriculum was modeled after the Jesuit Ratio Studiorum from Saint Louis University. Today the college, housed in O'Shaughnessy Hall, includes 20 departments in the areas of fine arts, humanities, and social sciences, and awards Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) degrees in 33 majors, making it the largest of the university's colleges. There are around 2,500 undergraduates and 750 graduates enrolled in the college.","LLM_1":"The college underwent significant expansion in the mid-19th century, with several new departments and programs being introduced. Notably, the English department, established in1855, became a hub for literary and cultural studies, producing notable alumni such as novelist and poet, Emily Wilson. As the college continued to grow, it also became known for its strong programs in languages, history, philosophy,  and the arts. By the turn of  the century the College had established a strong reputation as a centre for academic excellence and intellectual inquiry. This reputation would continue to shape the institution's development in years to come.  The College's commitment to intellectual pursuits had a lasting impact on American higher education. Its legacy can still be seen in its ongoing contributions to arts and letters. In the years following 1900 the  College would see a major expansion of its faculty, programs, facilities and student body. With this expansion came an increased focus on interdisciplinary research and study. New departments were established to support this research, including the Department of Comparative Literature, which would go on to become a leading centre in this field. Through its academic and research pursuits the University continued its long tradition of academic distinction. Academic achievements were not the only area in which the students excelled. Many students were also accomplished in other areas such sports, music, drama, art and other extracurricular activities. One notable student, poet and playwright, was Elizabeth, who later became the renowned playwright. Her work was often performed on campus. She and her contemporaries would come to be known as key figures in American literary renaissance. Their contributions were and continue  to  be celebrated and studied by scholars. During this period, students, faculty and alumni played a significant role in shaping the broader cultural landscape of their time. Despite the challenges posed by the economic downturn and social upheaval, The University's College continued  its  mission to foster the intellectual and creative pursuits of students. Throughout the early 20th  century this institution would remain a driving force in arts education in America. Over the course of this time, many students of The college would become influential figures, whose work would shape American culture. These individuals would include notable writers, artists, musicians, thinkers and leaders, in their respective fields. However, their achievements also had broader social implications. They would contribute to shaping public opinion, influencing policy and addressing social issues. Some of these notable individuals include the notable writer and philosopher, James, an alumnus of College. His philosophical treatise on social justice would influence generations of thinkers. He was not alone in his pursuit of social change. Other notable graduates, such  as  journalist and activist, Sarah, would also use their talents to advocate for social causes. Together, they demonstrated the power of arts  education to effect positive change in society. College  alumni would have a profound impact  on  American society, shaping cultural, intellectual, political and artistic discourse. While their work often challenged prevailing attitudes, values and norms, these individuals, as representatives of a liberal arts tradition, sought to enrich and expand the American experience. Though many faced opposition and criticism, College graduates persevered, believing in power  of knowledge and education  in making the world a better place. That legacy continues to inspire the community today. After many decades of service, one notable graduate  was honored as one of America's most  accomplished writers. \"In recognition of outstanding contributions  made  by  this   al  graduate to literature, education, public service and their enduring impact\" on society this  remarkable individual  received numerous accolades, awards and recognitions.

It is the first such move for 67 years.\nThe bonds that Chancellor George Osborne has acquired have a lower rate than the 4% interest on the debt.\nThe continued existence of the war bond debt illustrates the lasting shadow cast by World War One.\nAccording to the UK Treasury there are currently 11,200 registered holders of the bonds.\nWinston Churchill first issued \"4% Consols\" in 1927 when he was Chancellor partly to refinance bonds from the First World War.\nIn addition to the war bonds, some of the debt being refinanced by the Treasury dates back to the 18th Century.\nOne of these bonds was issued by William Gladstone in 1853 to consolidate the capital stock of the South Sea Company, which was founded in 1711.\nThe South Sea Company collapsed during the South Sea Bubble financial crisis of 1720, leaving behind it a lot of debt.\nIn 1932 Chancellor Neville Chamberlain converted some war bonds into \"perpetuals\". This gave the government the right not to pay back the loans, as long as they continued paying 3.5% interest on them.\nPerpetual bonds, as the name suggests, pay a steady stream of interest forever.","LLM_1":"This historic move marks a significant shift in the UK's borrowing strategy, which has been in place since the 1950s. Under the current system, the Treasury has traditionally re-invested the returns from maturing bonds into new debt, rather than using the funds to pay off the existing debt. However, with interest rates at historic lows and the country's economic recovery gathering pace, Osborne believes that now is an ideal time to reap the benefits of this new approach.\n\nThe plan involves re-financing approximately \u00a33.3 billion worth of existing bonds at market-determined rates, resulting in an estimated annual saving of around \u00a3200 million. This reduction in debt servicing costs will provide a welcome boost to public finances, allowing the government to redirect funds towards key areas such as infrastructure development, education, healthcare,  and welfare.\n\nCritics have welcomed the move, arguing that it demonstrates a much-needed shift towards more prudent fiscal management. \"This is a positive step towards a more sustainable borrowing model,\" said Rachel Reeves, Shadow Chief Secretary to HM Treasury. While some experts have expressed concerns about the potential impact on market volatility, most economists agree that this carefully timed intervention will ultimately benefit the economy. As the nation's finances continue to recover, it remains to be seen how this bold move will shape the future of UK borrowing. With the re-finance plan set to begin in 2019, all eyes will be on Osborne's administration as they navigate this significant change. \n\nThe government's decision to break with 68 years of tradition reflects its commitment to responsible financial stewardship. By embracing this innovative approach, they aim to create a stronger, more resilient economy for the long-term.  As one observer noted, \"It's a vital step in modernizing our debt management strategy.\"","LLM_2":"**Historic Shift in UK Borrowing Strategy**\n\nA significant milestone has marked a turning point in Britain's debt-management approach. Dating back to  the post-war era, when the last government in power first adopted this strategy.

But with historically low interest  rates and a burgeoning economic revival, Chancellor George Osborne now believes the time is ripe for a change.\n\n**New Approach to Borrowings**\n\nThe proposed plan aims to restructure approximately  \u00a333 billion of outstanding bonds, securing these at prevailing market rates. In doing so, an anticipated annual savings of \u00a3 200  million is expected. These reduced debt-servicing costs should provide an welcome respite to government coffers, enabling the authorities to channel these resources towards vital areas, including infrastructure, public education and healthcare.\n\nWhile some critics have praised this decision, hailing it as a move towards prudently managed finances. Shadow Treasury Minister Rachel  Reeves welcomed this development. Noting \"A step forward towards adopting a sustainable, long- term borrowing policy\".

{"human":"This paper describes the curation efforts to create a QA dataset on COVID-19. It collected 2,200 question-answer pairs from popular websites. Then it extracted 27, 000 unanswered questions from tweets, identified the most similar questions in the collection and provided top 5 answers. Then the provided answers were further manually annotated (whether they are relevant). Please see my comments below.\n\nFor the 27, 000 unanswered questions, it seems that only the questions similar to the existing questions in the collection can be kept. If an unanswered question is a new topic of COVID-19, the top retrieved answers will be irrelevant, and health experts will not provide new answers based on the description. Therefore, many new questions will be potentially missed. And what is the motivation of only annotating the questions that are similar to the existing questions in the collection? Critically, the questions that are significantly different from the existing questions are more valuable and need the power of manual curation. Adding these questions will enrich the datasets. In contrast, if a question is similar to the existing questions, adding it will just have one more similar instance. \n\nSecond, the study needs to explain how to use this dataset in detail. For instance, the statement 'Over 18, 000 examples were judged to be less than 1% relevant, indicating that the majority of the questions extracted from twitter are irrelevant to the answered questions in our dataset' seems that most of the questions do not have a precise answer yet. How to train a QA model in this case?\n\nThird, from the methodology level, while BM25 is effective, it does not capture the semantics of the questions. Did the study also try to use other methods to calculate the semantic similarity between the questions such as using word or sentence embedding?\n\nAlso importantly, the dataset is not public for now. More specific comments cannot be made.","LLM_1":"- The selection criteria for the 2,200 initial question-answer pairs from popular websites are not sufficiently detailed. It is unclear how these sources were vetted for reliability, whether they represent a diverse range of perspectives (e.g., public health agencies, academic institutions, medical journals), and how potential biases in source material might have been mitigated. A more transparent methodology regarding source inclusion and exclusion would strengthen the credibility of the foundational dataset.\n\n- While the use of similarity matching to link unanswered Twitter questions to existing answers is conceptually sound, the paper lacks a rigorous evaluation of the similarity model\u2019s performance. Metrics such as precision, recall, or F1-score on a held-out validation set would provide necessary evidence of its effectiveness. Furthermore, the choice of embedding model and distance metric should be justified with ablation studies or comparative analysis against alternatives.\n\n- The annotation process for relevance assessment requires further clarification. Specifically, information about the annotators\u2014such as their domain expertise, training procedures, and inter-annotator agreement (e.g., Cohen\u2019s kappa or Fleiss\u2019 kappa)\u2014is missing. Without this, it is difficult to assess the reliability and consistency of the manual labels, which are critical for downstream applications.\n\n- There is no discussion of temporal dynamics in the data, despite the rapidly evolving nature of scientific understanding during the pandemic. Questions and answers may become outdated or even misleading over time. The dataset would benefit from temporal tagging and possibly versioning to reflect changes in medical consensus, ensuring users can distinguish between early-pandemic guidance and current best practices.\n\n- The paper does not address potential ethical concerns related to using publicly available tweets. While tweets are public, extracting and repurposing user-generated content for research raises issues around informed consent, privacy, and data ownership. A brief section discussing compliance with platform policies and ethical guidelines (e.g., GDPR, IRB approval if applicable) would improve responsible research conduct transparency.\n\n- The distribution of question types across clinical, preventive, policy-related, and misinformation domains is unreported. Understanding this breakdown could help users gauge the dataset\u2019s applicability to specific NLP tasks such as fact-checking, medical QA, or public sentiment analysis. Providing a taxonomy or categorization schema would add significant value.\n\n- No error analysis is presented on cases where the top-5 retrieved answers were deemed irrelevant. Examining failure modes\u2014such as semantic drift, ambiguous queries, or out-of-domain questions\u2014could inform future improvements in retrieval models and highlight limitations that end-users should be aware of.\n\n- The dataset\u2019s potential for bias propagation warrants deeper investigation. For instance, popular websites may overrepresent certain demographics or geographic regions, and Twitter-based questions may skew toward English-speaking, urban, or younger populations. Quantifying or at least acknowledging these representational imbalances would enhance awareness of the dataset\u2019s limitations.\n\n- The authors do not explore multilinguality, even though public health communication during the pandemic occurred in multiple languages. Given that the dataset draws from global discourse, an assessment of language diversity in both the seed QA pairs and Twitter questions\u2014and plans for future expansion beyond English\u2014would broaden its impact.\n\n- Documentation regarding dataset formatting, accessibility, and licensing is sparse. Researchers require clear instructions on how to access the data, what usage rights are granted, and how to cite it properly. Including metadata fields such as confidence scores, source URLs, timestamps, and answer provenance would increase usability and reproducibility.\n\n- The paper would benefit from benchmarking baseline models on the proposed dataset. Demonstrating performance on tasks like answer relevance classification or question clustering provides immediate utility and helps situate the dataset within the broader landscape of biomedical QA resources.\n\n- There is limited discussion on how this dataset compares to existing efforts such as COV-QA, CORD-19, or TREC-COVID. A comparative table highlighting differences in scope, size, annotation quality, update frequency, and intended use cases would clarify the novel contribution and justify the need for another resource in an already active space.\n\n- The decision to limit annotations to binary relevance (relevant\/irrelevant) may oversimplify the complexity of medical responses. Some answers might be partially correct, context-dependent, or conditionally valid. Exploring multi-dimensional annotation schemes\u2014such as accuracy, completeness, and confidence\u2014could yield richer supervision signals for learning models.\n\n- Scalability of the curation pipeline remains unaddressed. If similar methods were applied to other diseases or public health crises, what components would generalize, and which would require domain-specific adaptation? A reflection on transferability strengthens the methodological contribution beyond the immediate context of COVID-19.\n\n- The role of automated filtering prior to manual annotation is underdescribed. Preprocessing steps such as deduplication, spam detection, or bot account filtering likely played a role in shaping the final set of 27,000 questions. Detailing these steps ensures reproducibility and guards against artifacts introduced by low-quality inputs.\n\n- The paper misses an opportunity to analyze linguistic characteristics of the Twitter-sourced questions. Features such as readability level, sentiment, presence of negation or uncertainty markers, or allusions to conspiracy theories could inform downstream applications in risk communication or misinformation detection.\n\n- Long-term maintenance and sustainability of the dataset are not discussed. Public health datasets often require updates as new evidence emerges. Outlining a plan for periodic revisions, community contributions, or integration with live knowledge bases would enhance its longevity and real-world utility.\n\n- Evaluation of retrieval diversity among the top-5 answers is absent. It is possible that high-similarity results are semantically redundant, offering little additional value. Metrics such as MRR or nDCG could be complemented with diversity-aware measures to ensure varied and informative response sets.\n\n- The work assumes that similarity implies answerability, but this may not always hold. Two questions can be syntactically or semantically close without sharing the same answerability status\u2014for example, one may ask for evidence while the other demands opinion. A discussion on the boundaries of transferable answers would refine expectations.\n\n- There is no indication of how unanswered questions were filtered for coherence or grammaticality. Informal language, typos, or incomplete sentences common in social media may affect matching performance. Describing normalization techniques or robustness mechanisms would improve clarity on system resilience.\n\n- The paper could better position itself within the literature on human-in-the-loop data curation. By framing manual annotation as part of an iterative refinement process, the authors could draw on established frameworks for active learning or disagreement-based sampling to optimize labeling efficiency.\n\n- Finally, while the effort represents a valuable contribution to pandemic-related NLP resources, the broader implications for crisis response infrastructure deserve mention. How might this approach be adapted for future outbreaks or emergency situations? Strategic reflections on rapid deployment, cross-agency collaboration, or integration with official communication channels would elevate the impact of the work.","LLM_2":"preserving the original meaning and critical substance while enhancing clarity, fluency, and tone to align with the conventions of academic peer review.

Without performance metrics such as precision, recall, or F1-score on a held-out validation set, it is difficult to assess the model\u2019s practical effectiveness. Additionally, the rationale for choosing specific embedding models and distance metrics should be supported by ablation studies or comparative analysis against alternative approaches.\n\n- The process for human annotation of relevance requires further elaboration. Key details\u2014including annotator qualifications, training protocols, and inter-annotator agreement statistics (e.g., Cohen\u2019s kappa or Fleiss\u2019 kappa)\u2014are missing. These elements are essential for evaluating the consistency and trustworthiness of the labeled data, which serve as a cornerstone for downstream modeling efforts.\n\n- The paper does not address temporal aspects of the data, despite the rapidly evolving nature of scientific knowledge during the pandemic.

{"human":"The paper proposes a new adversarial attack for the targeted blackbox model Unlike previous approaches which use the output layer possibly with some additional terms and regularization, the proposed approaches only rely on intermediate features. In fact, the adversarial example is based on a single intermediate layer. The adversarial examples are built by training, for each target class, a binary classifier for the class based only on the features of that layer.\n\n- There are multiple similar prior works that use intermediate layers in some way, and the paper does a good job to explain the differences between the proposed approach and these.\n\nThe paper proposes three variants. The simplest one appears rather weak in numerical experiments. The two other methods seem to achieve a different tradeoff, between focusing on the general error rate or on the targeted success rate.\n\nIn particular, FDA+fd is similar in some ways to Zhou et al. (2018) which uses an additional loss term to maximize the distance of the features at various layers. A comparison with this method (which uses the output layer) would be interesting, and may constitute a relevant additional baseline, at least for non-targeted metrics like error (which is where FDA+ms shines).\n\nSimilarly, a comparison to AA is provided in Figure 2 in the case of 10 classes, but not in Table 1 for the 1000 classes experiment. This casts some doubt on the significance of the result in the 1000 classes setting. A major issue with the proposed method is that training binary classifiers in large multi-class settings is quite costly, which is bound to hinder one's ability to identify 'high performing attack settings' In particular, the paper mentions that the 10 classes are used for that, but no evidence is provided that these settings are actually good for all classes.\n\nThe conclusions are rather consistent accross different pairs of source\/target network.\n\nThe paper does not mention adversarial training. As this has become a common defence practice in the literature, it would be interesting to understand to what extent the proposed methods are thwarted by adversarial training. This could increase the significance of the paper if working with intermediate feature representation makes the attack more robust to this type of defense.\n\nIn summary, I find the experiments satisfying, although they can definitely be made more convincing by adding additional strong baselines and demonstrating how much performance can really be attained in the 1000 classes scenario.\n\n- Generally, not using the output layer at all is an interesting approach that deserves in my opinion to be discussed and investigated further.\n\n- The paper is clearly written, and notation is rigorous.","LLM_1":"- The core idea of leveraging a single intermediate layer to train binary classifiers per target class introduces an interesting simplification in the adversarial example generation pipeline.

By operating earlier in the network\u2019s representational hierarchy, the method sidesteps potential defenses that rely on output randomization or softmax masking\u2014common countermeasures in production-grade models. Moreover, intermediate features tend to encode more generalizable patterns than high-level logits, which may contribute to improved cross-model efficacy. However, the justification for selecting *one specific* intermediate layer\u2014rather than exploring or adaptively choosing across multiple candidates\u2014is not thoroughly discussed. Given that different layers capture distinct levels of abstraction (e.g., low-level edges in early layers vs. semantic motifs in deeper ones), the performance of the binary classifiers could vary significantly depending on depth. A more systematic ablation over layer depth (e.g., early vs. mid vs. late) would strengthen the empirical claims and provide practical guidance for future applications.

Testing under architecture mismatch conditions\u2014such as training the binary classifiers on ResNet features while attacking a ViT-based target\u2014would offer stronger evidence of generalizability. Furthermore, incorporating heterogeneous data modalities (e.g., using a CNN-derived surrogate to attack a vision-language model like CLIP) would test whether the approach extends beyond conventional classification pipelines. Such stress-testing would also reveal whether the learned classifiers exploit universal feature regularities or merely memorize architecture-specific artifacts.\n\n- The three proposed variants appear to differ primarily in how the binary classification objective is formulated (e.g., margin-based, confidence-aware, or prototype-driven). Although all variants are evaluated quantitatively, the paper lacks a detailed analysis of *why* certain variants outperform others in particular settings. For example, if the prototype-driven variant excels on fine-grained datasets like Birds or Aircrafts, this might suggest it benefits from capturing class-specific centroids in feature space\u2014potentially aligning with human-interpretable notions of category typicality. Conversely, a margin-based formulation might perform better on noisy or imbalanced distributions by emphasizing separation boundaries rather than density estimation. A deeper investigation into the decision boundaries learned by each variant, possibly via visualization or geometric analysis of feature-space separability, could provide valuable insights into their relative effectiveness and guide downstream selection. Techniques such as t-SNE projections of support vectors, Lipschitz constant estimation around decision regions, or sensitivity analysis to feature perturbations could illuminate structural differences in classifier behavior and help explain observed performance gaps.\n\n- One notable strength lies in the interpretability of the attack mechanism: since each binary classifier operates only on a fixed set of features, it becomes possible to analyze what aspects of the representation are being exploited. It would be beneficial if the authors included qualitative examples showing which features are most activated during successful attacks. Feature attribution methods such as Grad-CAM applied to the binary classifiers themselves\u2014or simple ranking based on weight magnitudes\u2014could highlight spatially localized or channel-wise dominant activations. Such analysis could also help distinguish whether the attack exploits semantically meaningful concepts (e.g., \"wings\" for birds) or spurious correlations within the intermediate layer (e.g., background textures or rendering artifacts). Additional probing experiments\u2014such as ablation studies where certain feature channels are masked or shuffled\u2014might further disentangle causal contributions from mere co-occurrence, offering a clearer picture of vulnerability sources in deep representations.\n\n- The computational cost of training one binary classifier per target class may become prohibitive in large-scale settings with hundreds or thousands of classes. For instance, in ImageNet-scale scenarios, this implies maintaining and optimizing 1,000 separate models\u2014an overhead that grows linearly with label space size. The paper does not address this scalability concern, nor does it propose strategies to amortize training costs (e.g., through shared representations or meta-learning). One promising direction could involve parameter-efficient architectures such as hypernetworks or adapter modules that generate classifier weights conditionally based on class embeddings. Alternatively, multi-task learning frameworks with hard or soft parameter sharing across classifiers might reduce redundancy without sacrificing performance. A discussion on efficiency trade-offs\u2014especially compared to gradient-free or score-based black-box methods that require only query access\u2014would add practical relevance to the approach. Including runtime comparisons, memory footprints, or FLOPs-per-inference metrics would ground the method in deployable contexts.\n\n- Regarding reproducibility, the paper would benefit from clearer specifications on hyperparameter selection for the binary classifiers (e.g., architecture, learning rate, number of epochs). Given that performance likely depends on the quality of these auxiliary models, small variations in training setup could significantly impact results. For example, using shallow MLPs versus logistic regression, or varying regularization strengths, might lead to divergent conclusions about attack effectiveness. Including training curves or validation accuracy of the binary classifiers themselves would help contextualize their reliability as attack drivers. Were these classifiers near-perfect on the surrogate task, or did they operate under significant uncertainty? Their predictive fidelity directly influences the precision of the induced perturbations. Providing code snippets or configuration files alongside the supplementary material would further enhance transparency and enable direct replication across diverse computing environments.\n\n- The claim that the method \u201conly relies on intermediate features\u201d warrants careful scrutiny. If the binary classifiers are trained using labeled data, then ground-truth labels are implicitly required during the *preparation phase* of the attack.

Clarifying the extent of knowledge assumed\u2014particularly about class semantics and labeling conventions\u2014is essential for proper positioning within the adversarial literature. For instance, can the attack succeed under label noise, partial supervision, or completely unsupervised pre-training of the binary classifiers? Exploring weakly supervised alternatives\u2014such as clustering-based pseudo-labeling or self-supervised discriminators\u2014could push the boundary toward true black-box applicability. Additionally, discussing assumptions about dataset overlap between surrogate and target domains (e.g., same image distribution, class alignment) would clarify feasibility in realistic deployment scenarios.\n\n- Transferability experiments are presented, but they focus mainly on success rates across models. Complementing these with analyses of attack diversity (e.g., variance in perturbation patterns across runs) and robustness to defensive distillation or input transformations would offer a more comprehensive view of practical viability. High success rates alone do not guarantee resilience against common preprocessing defenses such as JPEG compression, random cropping, or bit-depth reduction. Evaluating attack persistence under such transformations would assess its operational durability. Additionally, measuring the entropy of generated perturbations across multiple trials could indicate whether the method produces consistent adversarial signals or exhibits high stochastic variability\u2014a factor critical for evading anomaly detection systems. Evaluating against recent defense mechanisms such as randomized smoothing or feature denoising could further validate the attack\u2019s potency. If the method remains effective despite these protections, it underscores a fundamental fragility in current representation learning paradigms.\n\n- The writing is generally clear and well-organized, with effective use of figures to illustrate the framework. However, some technical details\u2014such as the exact formulation of the loss functions used in the three variants\u2014are deferred to the appendix without sufficient high-level intuition in the main text. Integrating brief conceptual descriptions of these losses would improve accessibility for readers less familiar with optimization-centric formulations. For example, explaining the margin-based loss as encouraging maximal separation between target and non-target feature clusters, or framing the confidence-aware variant as down-weighting uncertain predictions, would aid comprehension without sacrificing rigor. Analogies to classical machine learning objectives (e.g., SVM-like margins, logistic regression calibration) could further bridge understanding across audiences. Visual schematics depicting how each loss shapes the decision boundary in a simplified 2D embedding space might also enhance pedagogical value.\n\n- Finally, while the paper makes a compelling case for rethinking the role of intermediate layers in adversarial attacks, it stops short of exploring potential defensive implications. If such features are indeed vulnerable to targeted manipulation via simple classifiers, this raises concerns about the inherent robustness of deep representations. Are modern networks over-relying on linearly separable subspaces that are easily exploitable? A forward-looking discussion on how model designers might detect or mitigate such vulnerabilities\u2014perhaps by regularizing feature linearity or promoting classifier diversity across layers\u2014could elevate the paper\u2019s broader impact. For instance, introducing orthogonality constraints between successive layer transformations or injecting adversarial feature denoising modules during training might disrupt the attacker\u2019s ability to build reliable binary surrogates. More broadly, this work invites reflection on whether feature interpretability and model security are inherently at odds\u2014an important tension in trustworthy AI development.","op1":"create","op2":"expand","domain":"openreview","model":"Qwen"}

Their owners, caught off guard, struggled to regain control over their pets. Some dogs yelped in excitement, while others whined in frustration, unsure of what to make of this sudden change in their routine.\n\nThe cats watched the chaos with an air of detachment, grooming themselves with deliberate precision.

{"human":"Children with severe or persistent back pain and stiffness often have an underlying organic cause but there is a large differential diagnosis, examination may be difficult and the problem is relatively rare in general paediatric practice. These difficulties appeared to lead to delays in diagnosis and management of children with this problem.To provide an approach to the diagnosis and management children with severe or persistent back pain or stiffness based on our clinical experience and the literature.The case histories of 10 children with severe back pain seen by the authors over a 5-year period were reviewed. They were chosen as illustrative examples of the diagnostic and management problems and did not represent a systematic review of all cases seen by the authors over that time.Underlying causes included infection, inflammation, neoplasm, trauma and vascular malformation. Four of the children had spinal cord compression which required urgent decompression. There was one child with a conversion disorder but three children with organic disease were initially felt to have a conversion disorder. Investigations generally proceeded relatively slowly and the problem was not regarded as a semi-urgent situation carrying the risk of permanent paraplegia. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the spine was the investigation of choice.","LLM_1":"Despite the challenges in diagnosing and managing children presenting with chronic back and joint pain, recent advances in medical imaging and laboratory testing have improved our ability to identify underlying causes.  The development of advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques, such as diffusion-weighted imaging, has enhanced the detection of inflammatory and neoplastic processes in the spine and musculoskeletal system. Furthermore, the application of serum biomarkers, including cytokines and autoantibodies, allows for the non-invasive assessment of immune system dysregulation. However, these advances have also highlighted the need for a multidisciplinary approach to care, involving specialists from paediatrics, rheumatology, orthopaedics, neurology, radiology and pathology, to ensure comprehensive diagnosis. A collaborative, evidence-based framework for managing these complex cases is essential to reduce diagnostic delays, improve treatment outcomes and enhance quality of life for affected children. \n\nThis framework should incorporate a systematic approach, encompassing the integration of clinical history, physical examination, imaging studies, laboratory tests and, where appropriate, muscululoskeletal ultrasound. Moreover, consideration should also be given to incorporating patient and family perspectives, through the use of validated symptom and functional assessment tools, in order to inform treatment decisions and facilitate shared decision-making. In conclusion, addressing the complexities of chronic paedriatric backpain requires a multifaceted, team-based approach that incorporates cutting-edge diagnostic modalities, innovative therapeutic strategies and a patient-centered perspective. By adopting this framework, healthcare providers can optimise the care of these challenging cases and improve the health and well-being of affected young patients. Ultimately, this may contribute to a reduction in long-term sequelae, enhanced quality-of-life outcomes, improved patient satisfaction and satisfaction with care. Finally, there may also a positive impact on overall healthcare utilization and costs. This will be discussed in future work. Future research directions may include the development and validation of novel diagnostic and prognostic tools. Additionally, further investigation into innovative treatment modalites is also warranted. As a first step, our group will conduct a comprehensive review of existing literature and develop a conceptual framework to guide future research. Together, we can improve our understanding of this complex condition and ultimately enhance the quality and effectiveness of care for these vulnerable patients","LLM_2":"Despite  the  challenges  in  diagnos- ing  and  managing  children  presenting  with  chronic  back  pain  (CBP)  or  joint  pains,  recent  advances  have  significantly  improved  our  ability  to  identify  underlying  causes  of  these  debilitating  conditions.   The  development  has  been  accelerated  by  advancements  made  on  medical  imaging  techniques. For instance, advanced  magnetic  resonance  imag-  ing (mMRI), such  as  diffusion-weigh- ted  MRI,   has   enhanced   the   detection   of   inflammatory   and   neoplast- ic   processes   in   both   spine   (scoliosis, spondylolisthesis) and the musculo-skeletal  system, thereby aiding in more accurate diagnoses. Another breakthrough in this field is the utilisation of high-resolution musulosketel ultrasound which has been instrumental in aiding early detection and monitoring of joint diseases, as well as in guiding injections and interventions.\n\nFurthermore, advances made in laboratory diagnostics have allowed us to better understand the underlying immune responses that contribute significantly to these children's conditions, by detecting and measuring serum bio-markers, cytokine levels and specific auto-antigen profiles. These bio- markers include, but are not limited to, inflammatory cytok- ine IL-6, tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) as seen in conditions like juvenile idiopathic arthritis, serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), rheumatic factor and anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA). The latter can be indicative of autoimmune conditions such lupus or rheuma- toid arthritis. Consequently, it is imperative that clinicians are well-versed in these advancements, enabling them to diagnose and manage these conditions effectively.\n\nDespite these progressions, diagnosi- ng and treating these cases remain challeng- in, due to their complex nature and multifactorial pathogenesis. Therefore, a multi-disciplinary team of specialists is indispensable, comprising paediatricians, paed- iatrics rheumotologists, specialist ortho- paedic surgeons, neuropathologists and radiologists. Each of their expertise brings a unique perspective to diagn- osing and manag- aging these patients, ensuring that comprehensive and timely diagnoses are made, thus reducing diagnostic delay. Subsequently, effective treatment plans can then be formulated, leading to improved outcomes.\n\nTo further improve outcomes in managing chronic paedi- atric back pain and its associated conditions requires an evidence- based, collaborative framework. Within this context, clinical his- tory, thorough physical examinations, image- ning studies (including MRI and X-rays), laboratory investigations and where appro- priate, use musuculoskeletel ultrasounds should be fully integrated. Patient and parental perspectives should not be overlooked and should therefore be considered through validated tools such symptom- and function- assessment questionnaires. Such tools have been proven to enhance patient engagement and shared-decision making, ultimately leading improved quality- of-life and reduced symptoms.\n\nMoreover, adopting a holistic approach should include access to psychological support, helping the children and their families cope with the stress and emotional challenges associated with their conditions.\n\nIn conclusion addressing these challenges re- quires a team-approach incorporating cut- ting-edge diagnostics and therapeutics, along with a focus on patient-centric care and involving the patient's perspective, their family and carers in their care pathway. Adopting this multidis- ciplinary framework can lead to optimal care outcomes for children with these debilitating conditions and also has the potential to contribute towards a reduced incidence of long term sequel- ae and enhanced overall well being.\n\nTherefore, conducting research and developing novel tools to aid in diagnosis, treatment and patient management is crucial. Our group aims to do this by conducting a thorough review existing research, developing a framework that will guide our future reseach and collaborate with other experts in field to develop and validate novel diagnost-ic and therapeutic tools.\n\nFuture research should aim at exploring novel treatment approaches such immunotherapies and stem-cell therapies. Further- more, investigating how new technologies such artificial intelligence can enhance diagnosis and treatment of paedatiric chronic conditions is warranted.\n\nBy doing so, together, clinicians, researchers, patients and families can work towards improving our current understanding and management of paeditaric conditions associated to chronic pain. We can ultimately improve care pathways, outcomes of treatment, patient well-bing, quality life and reduce the burden on families and healthcare systems. Hence, reducing the incidence and severity of conditions that impact this vulnerable group. They are the future and deserve the best possible care we have to offer. Lastly, future studies may focus further on reducing healthcare utilisaition and associated costs, hence leading a more effective, efficient and equitable healthcare delivery system for all. \"","op1":"create","op2":"expand","domain":"pubmedqa","model":"llama"}

{"human":"This paper presents a set of studies on emergent communication protocols in referential games that use either symbolic object representations or pixel-level representations of generated images as input. The work is extremely creative and packed with interesting experiments.\n\nI have three main comments.\n\n* CLARITY OF EXPOSITION\n\nThe paper was rather hard to read. I'll provide some suggestions for improvement in the minor-comments section below, but one thing that could help a lot is to establish terminology at the beginning, and be consistent with it throughout the paper: what is a word, a message, a protocol, a vocabulary, a lexicon? etc.\n\n* RELATION BETWEEN VOCABULARY SIZE AND PROTOCOL SIZE\n\nIn the compositional setup considered by the authors, agents can choose how many basic symbols to use and the length of the \"words\" they will form with these symbols. There is virtually no discussion of this interesting interplay in the paper. Also, there is no information about the length distribution of words (in basic symbols), and no discussion of whether the latter was meaningful in any way.\n\n* RELATION BETWEEN CONCEPT-PROPERTY AND RAW-PIXEL STUDIES\n\nThe two studies rely on different analyses, and it is difficult to compare them. I realize that it would be impossible to report perfectly comparable analyses, but the authors could at least apply the \"topographic\" analysis of compositionality in the raw-pixel study as well, either by correlating the CNN-based representational similarities of the Speaker with its message similarities, or computing similarity of the inputs in discretized, symbolic terms (or both?)\n\n* MINOR\/DETAILED COMMENTS\n\nSection 1\n\nHow do you think emergent communication experiments can shed light on language acquisition?\n\nSection 2\n\nIn figure 1, the two agents point at nothing.\n\n\\mathbf{v} is a set, but it's denoted as a vector.

While the paper makes a compelling case for studying both modalities, the comparative framework lacks depth in identifying *how* and *why* communication strategies diverge when moving from clean symbolic representations to high-dimensional, noisy visual inputs. For instance, do agents resort to more holistic (less compositional) signaling in the pixel setting due to representational ambiguity? Is there evidence of abstraction or feature chunking in message formation that mirrors human perceptual categorization? A direct comparison of message similarity structures\u2014e.g., via representational similarity analysis (RSA)\u2014across the two setups could have provided valuable insights into whether learned protocols adapt systematically to input modality.\n\nFurthermore, the lack of shared evaluation metrics between the two studies limits interpretability. In the symbolic case, compositionality is assessed via productivity and systematicity, while in the pixel case, the focus shifts to reconstruction accuracy and mutual information. Introducing a common set of diagnostic tests\u2014such as generalization to novel combinations or sensitivity to attribute substitution\u2014would strengthen the claim that these are variations on the same underlying phenomenon rather than isolated experiments.\n\n* EVALUATION OF COMPOSITIONALITY AND GENERALIZATION  \nWhile the paper references compositionality as a central theme, the operational definition remains underspecified. The authors would benefit from applying standardized metrics such as the position-invariant product (PIP) score or context independence (CI) to quantify the degree of compositionality in the emergent languages. Without such measures, claims about compositional structure remain largely qualitative and impressionistic.\n\nMoreover, the absence of systematic generalization tests is a notable gap. For example, did agents succeed when presented with object combinations not seen during training\u2014such as a color-shape pairing excluded from the training distribution? Testing zero-shot or few-shot generalization would provide stronger evidence that the agents are learning structured representations rather than memorizing input-output mappings. This is especially important in the pixel-input setting, where overfitting to spurious correlations is more likely.\n\n* LACK OF CONTROL FOR DEGENERACY AND SIGNAL COLLISION  \nAn underexplored risk in the variable-length messaging setup is degeneracy: the possibility that different messages map to the same meaning, or that structurally distinct \"words\" become functionally equivalent through usage. The paper does not analyze whether the learned vocabulary exhibits redundancy or whether the protocol collapses into a small set of frequently reused signals. A simple analysis\u2014such as measuring type-token ratios over time or clustering message embeddings\u2014could reveal whether the system develops a rich lexicon or converges to a minimal viable code.\n\nAdditionally, the potential for signal collision\u2014where similar messages refer to dissimilar objects\u2014should be examined, particularly in the pixel setting. If small perturbations in input lead to large shifts in message semantics, this would suggest instability in the protocol. Conversely, if semantically similar objects yield similar messages, this would support the emergence of meaningful structure.\n\n* ROLE OF ARCHITECTURAL INDUCTIVE BIASES  \nThe choice of neural architectures plays a crucial but unacknowledged role in shaping the emergent protocols. For instance, the use of RNNs versus Transformers for message generation may influence whether agents develop sequential, hierarchical, or flat communication strategies. Similarly, the encoder architecture in the pixel setting\u2014particularly whether it includes explicit bottlenecks or attention mechanisms\u2014may predispose the system toward certain types of abstractions.\n\nThe paper would benefit from a discussion of how architectural choices constrain or enable specific properties of the learned language. Even a brief ablation study\u2014e.g., comparing LSTM-based vs. CNN-based encoders\u2014could shed light on whether observed patterns are driven by task demands or model design.\n\n* INTERPRETABILITY OF MESSAGE SEMANTICS  \nAlthough the paper presents t-SNE visualizations of message spaces, these are descriptive rather than explanatory. To move beyond visualization, the authors could apply probing techniques to identify which object attributes (e.g., color, shape, size) are encoded at different positions in the message. For example, training linear probes on individual message tokens might reveal whether certain positions consistently encode specific features\u2014strong evidence of syntactic structure.\n\nIn the pixel setting, one could further investigate whether messages align with human-interpretable image features (e.g., edges, textures, parts) by correlating message activations with saliency maps or concept activation vectors (TCAV). Such analyses would bridge the gap between emergent communication and established methods in vision interpretability.\n\n* SCALABILITY AND ROBUSTNESS OF LEARNED PROTOCOLS  \nThe current setup involves relatively small vocabularies and short sequences. It remains unclear whether the observed phenomena scale to more complex environments with larger attribute spaces or deeper compositional hierarchies. A scalability analysis\u2014varying the number of object properties or the depth of combination rules\u2014could reveal phase transitions in communication efficiency or compositionality.\n\nLikewise, robustness to noise or channel degradation is unexamined. Introducing controlled noise into the message transmission (e.g., symbol deletion or substitution) would test whether the protocols develop error-resilient features, such as redundancy or delimiters. This has implications for understanding how robust communication systems emerge under uncertainty.\n\n* POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN ALIGNMENT  \nA missed opportunity lies in not testing whether the emergent protocols can be understood or used by humans. Even a minimal experiment\u2014asking human participants to match messages to images based on trained agent data\u2014could assess whether the learned codes exhibit any degree of intuitive transparency. Alternatively, initializing agent pre-linguistic states with human-generated labels or sketches might probe whether grounding in natural language biases the system toward more interpretable solutions.\n\nThis line of inquiry connects to broader goals in AI alignment: if artificial agents develop private languages, can we ensure they remain comprehensible or controllable? The current work provides a foundation for such investigations but stops short of engaging with them.\n\n* METHODOLOGICAL TRANSPARENCY AND REPRODUCIBILITY  \nSeveral key implementation details are missing, limiting reproducibility. These include: the exact architecture sizes (e.g., embedding dimensions, hidden units), optimization hyperparameters (e.g., learning rates, batch sizes), and the number of random seeds used. Additionally, the paper does not specify whether weight sharing was applied between sender and receiver networks, which can significantly affect symmetry and convergence.\n\nProviding full training curves\u2014not just final performance metrics\u2014would help clarify learning dynamics. For example, does compositionality emerge early or late in training? Are there periods of instability or rapid reorganization in the message space? These temporal patterns are often informative about the learning process.\n\nFinally, the code and data availability statement should be made explicit. Given the complexity of the experiments, open-sourcing the implementation would greatly enhance the impact and verifiability of the results.\n\n* FUTURE DIRECTIONS AND THEORETICAL IMPLICATIONS  \nThe findings open several promising avenues for future work. One direction is to extend the framework to multi-round dialogues, where agents negotiate referents through clarification requests or descriptions. This would allow the study of interactive alignment\u2014a key mechanism in human language evolution.\n\nAnother direction is to incorporate memory or theory of mind, enabling agents to model each other\u2019s knowledge states. This could lead to more efficient or adaptive communication strategies, such as tailoring messages based on inferred listener uncertainty.\n\nFrom a theoretical standpoint, the work contributes to the growing literature on the origins of structure in language. However, it would benefit from deeper engagement with linguistic typology. For example, do the emergent protocols resemble isolating, agglutinative, or fusional languages in their morphological structure? Framing the results in terms of known language universals could strengthen the connection to cognitive science.\n\nIn summary, this is a rich and thought-provoking contribution that pushes the boundaries of emergent communication research. With improvements in exposition, analysis depth, and methodological clarity, it has the potential to become a landmark study in the field.","LLM_2":"* **COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF COMMUNICATION STRATEGIES ACROSS MODALITIES**  \nThe transition from symbolic to pixel-based inputs introduces significant complexity in how agents structure their communication, fundamentally altering the nature of information encoding and decoding. While the paper makes a compelling case for studying both modalities, the comparative framework lacks depth in identifying *how* and *why* communication strategies diverge when moving from clean symbolic representations\u2014where meaning is discrete, unambiguous, and directly mappable\u2014to high-dimensional, noisy visual inputs that require perceptual parsing and abstraction under uncertainty. This shift mirrors core challenges in human language acquisition, where linguistic forms must be grounded in rich sensory experience rather than pre-defined symbols.\n\nFor instance, do agents resort to more holistic (less compositional) signaling in the pixel setting due to representational ambiguity and increased perceptual noise? In symbolic environments, agents can exploit precise feature separability\u2014color, shape, size\u2014allowing for systematic recombinability. In contrast, raw pixels force agents to jointly learn perception and communication, potentially leading to entangled message representations that prioritize discriminative power over interpretability. Is there evidence of abstraction or feature chunking in message formation\u2014such as grouping red triangles into a single semantic unit\u2014that mirrors human perceptual categorization mechanisms like prototype formation or Gestalt grouping principles?\n\nA direct comparison of message similarity structures across the two setups using representational similarity analysis (RSA) could have provided valuable insights into whether learned protocols adapt systematically to input modality. By aligning representational dissimilarity matrices derived from agent messages with those based on ground-truth object attributes (e.g., color distance, shape overlap), one could quantify the extent to which each protocol preserves meaningful semantic distinctions. Such analyses might reveal whether pixel-trained agents develop graded, continuous codes akin to natural language semantics, while symbolic agents converge on sharply delineated categories.\n\nFurthermore, the lack of shared evaluation metrics between the two studies limits interpretability and undermines cross-modal generalizations. In the symbolic case, compositionality is assessed via productivity and systematicity\u2014classic hallmarks of linguistic structure\u2014while in the pixel case, the focus shifts to reconstruction accuracy and mutual information, which measure fidelity but not necessarily structural richness. Introducing a common set of diagnostic tests\u2014such as generalization to novel combinations (e.g., unseen color-shape pairs), sensitivity to attribute substitution (e.g., swapping colors across objects), or robustness to distractors\u2014would strengthen the claim that these are variations on the same underlying phenomenon rather than isolated experiments governed by different success criteria. Without such alignment, it remains unclear whether differences in emergent structure reflect inherent properties of the task or merely artifacts of divergent measurement frameworks.\n\n---\n\n* **EVALUATION OF COMPOSITIONALITY AND GENERALIZATION**  \nWhile the paper references compositionality as a central theme, the operational definition remains underspecified, leaving key claims about linguistic structure unsupported by quantitative evidence. The authors would benefit from applying standardized metrics such as the position-invariant product (PIP) score or context independence (CI) to objectively quantify the degree of compositionality in the emergent languages. These measures assess whether meaning depends primarily on individual components (tokens) rather than arbitrary configurations\u2014a crucial distinction between truly compositional systems and superficially structured mappings.\n\nWithout such metrics, claims about compositional structure remain largely qualitative and impressionistic, relying on visual inspection of message patterns without rigorous statistical validation. For example, observing repeated substrings across messages may suggest systematicity, but without measuring token-position stability or conducting permutation tests, this observation alone cannot confirm syntactic regularity.\n\nMoreover, the absence of systematic generalization tests represents a notable gap in evaluating cognitive plausibility and functional utility. Did agents succeed when presented with object combinations not seen during training\u2014such as a green pentagon excluded from the training distribution\u2014or did performance degrade sharply, indicating reliance on memorization rather than rule-like behavior? Testing zero-shot or few-shot generalization would provide stronger evidence that the agents are learning structured representations capable of supporting flexible inference. This is especially important in the pixel-input setting, where overfitting to spurious correlations\u2014such as background textures or lighting artifacts\u2014is more likely due to the high dimensionality and redundancy of visual data. Evaluating out-of-distribution generalization could also illuminate whether agents extract abstract, invariant features or latch onto superficial cues.\n\nAdditionally, probing for productivity\u2014whether agents can express new meanings through recombination beyond the training vocabulary\u2014would further validate claims of open-ended expressive capacity. A failure to generalize compositionally would imply that the system functions more as a lookup table than a generative grammar, undermining its relevance to models of natural language evolution.\n\n---\n\n* **LACK OF CONTROL FOR DEGENERACY AND SIGNAL COLLISION**  \nAn underexplored risk in the variable-length messaging setup is degeneracy: the possibility that different messages map to the same meaning, or that structurally distinct \"words\" become functionally equivalent through usage. Degeneracy is a well-documented phenomenon in biological and artificial communication systems; however, the paper does not analyze whether the learned vocabulary exhibits redundancy or whether the protocol collapses into a small set of frequently reused signals. Over time, pressure for efficiency may drive agents toward minimal coding schemes, sacrificing expressivity for speed\u2014an effect known as lexical contraction.\n\nA simple yet informative analysis\u2014such as measuring type-token ratios over time or clustering message embeddings\u2014could reveal whether the system develops a rich lexicon or converges to a minimal viable code. Declining lexical diversity coupled with increasing message reuse would suggest an evolutionary drift toward pragmatically efficient but semantically impoverished communication. Similarly, examining entropy in message distributions could indicate whether agents maintain a balance between predictability and informativeness, consistent with Zipf\u2019s Law of abbreviation.\n\nAdditionally, the potential for signal collision\u2014where similar messages refer to dissimilar objects\u2014should be examined, particularly in the pixel setting. If small perturbations in input lead to large shifts in message semantics, this would suggest instability in the protocol and poor resilience to perceptual noise. Conversely, if semantically similar objects yield similar messages\u2014even in latent space\u2014this would support the emergence of meaningful, gradient structure analogous to semantic manifolds in human cognition. One could test this by introducing controlled image transformations (e.g., hue shifts, affine distortions) and measuring message divergence via cosine distance or optimal transport metrics. Such findings would clarify whether the system supports smooth generalization or operates in a brittle, categorical regime.\n\n---\n\n* **ROLE OF ARCHITECTURAL INDUCTIVE BIASES**  \nThe choice of neural architectures plays a crucial but unacknowledged role in shaping the emergent protocols, acting as implicit priors that constrain the space of possible solutions. For instance, the use of RNNs versus Transformers for message generation may influence whether agents develop sequential, hierarchical, or flat communication strategies. RNNs, with their inherent temporal dynamics, may encourage incremental message construction and left-to-right dependencies, whereas Transformers\u2014with their global attention and positional encoding\u2014may facilitate parallel feature binding or even recursive embedding, depending on depth and training regimen.\n\nSimilarly, the encoder architecture in the pixel setting\u2014particularly whether it includes explicit bottlenecks (e.g., variational autoencoder latents), attention mechanisms (e.g., self-attention in ViTs), or hierarchical pooling\u2014may predispose the system toward certain types of abstractions. A CNN with fixed receptive fields may promote part-based decomposition, while a vision transformer may attend to configural wholes or relational patterns. These architectural biases can profoundly affect whether agents learn disentangled, interpretable features or opaque, holistic representations.\n\nThe paper would benefit from a discussion of how architectural choices constrain or enable specific properties of the learned language. Even a brief ablation study\u2014e.g., comparing LSTM-based vs. CNN-based encoders, or varying attention heads in the sender network\u2014could shed light on whether observed patterns are driven by task demands or model design. For example, does compositionality emerge only when the encoder enforces modularity? Do attention maps align with human-annotated salient regions? Addressing these questions would move the work beyond descriptive reporting toward mechanistic understanding.\n\n---\n\n* **INTERPRETABILITY OF MESSAGE SEMANTICS**  \nAlthough the paper presents t-SNE visualizations of message spaces, these are descriptive rather than explanatory, offering limited insight into the internal organization of meaning. To move beyond visualization, the authors could apply probing techniques to identify which object attributes (e.g., color, shape, size) are encoded at different positions in the message. Training linear probes on individual message tokens might reveal whether certain positions consistently encode specific features\u2014a strong indicator of syntactic structure reminiscent of fixed-role grammars.\n\nIn the pixel setting, one could further investigate whether messages align with human-interpretable image features (e.g., edges, textures, parts) by correlating message activations with saliency maps generated via Grad-CAM or concept activation vectors (TCAV). For instance, do early message tokens correspond to low-level visual primitives, while later ones capture higher-order configurations? Are there identifiable \u201cconcept neurons\u201d within the message space that fire selectively for particular shapes or colors?\n\nSuch analyses would bridge the gap between emergent communication and established methods in vision interpretability, situating the findings within broader efforts to understand representation learning in deep networks. Moreover, they could help distinguish between shallow correlation and deep understanding: if message units track semantically coherent concepts rather than pixel-level statistics, this would lend credibility to claims of genuine conceptual grounding.\n\n---\n\n* **SCALABILITY AND ROBUSTNESS OF LEARNED PROTOCOLS**  \nThe current setup involves relatively small vocabularies and short sequences, raising concerns about the scalability of observed phenomena to more complex environments with larger attribute spaces or deeper compositional hierarchies. It remains unclear whether the emergent communication strategies generalize beyond toy domains. A scalability analysis\u2014systematically varying the number of object properties (e.g., adding material, orientation, motion) or increasing the depth of combination rules (e.g., nested descriptions like \u201cthe red triangle inside the blue square\u201d)\u2014could reveal phase transitions in communication efficiency, redundancy, or compositionality.\n\nFor example, do agents maintain systematicity as combinatorial complexity grows, or does the system break down into ad hoc, case-specific codes? At what point do agents begin to develop delimiters, scoping mechanisms, or recursion-like structures to manage complexity? Answering these questions would inform theories about the conditions under which full-fledged linguistic structure emerges.\n\nLikewise, robustness to noise or channel degradation is unexamined, despite its relevance to real-world deployment and biological plausibility. Introducing controlled noise into the message transmission\u2014such as symbol deletion, insertion, or substitution\u2014would test whether the protocols develop error-resilient features, such as redundancy, checksum-like patterns, or delimiter tokens. Natural languages exhibit many such safeguards (e.g., phonotactic constraints, prosodic boundaries); observing analogous adaptations in artificial systems would strengthen parallels between simulated and evolved communication.\n\n---\n\n* **POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN ALIGNMENT**  \nA missed opportunity lies in not testing whether the emergent protocols can be understood or used by humans. Even a minimal experiment\u2014asking human participants to match messages to images based on trained agent data\u2014could assess whether the learned codes exhibit any degree of intuitive transparency or cross-species intelligibility. If untrained humans perform significantly above chance, this would suggest that the agents have converged on perceptually natural or cognitively accessible coding principles.\n\nAlternatively, initializing agent pre-linguistic states with human-generated labels, sketches, or iconographic prompts might probe whether grounding in natural language biases the system toward more interpretable or aligned solutions. This approach echoes recent work in cooperative VQA and human-in-the-loop language learning, where shared priors accelerate convergence and improve usability.\n\nThis line of inquiry connects directly to broader goals in AI alignment: if artificial agents develop private languages, can we ensure they remain comprehensible, controllable, and safe? The current work provides a foundation for such investigations but stops short of engaging with them. Incorporating human feedback loops or designing bidirectional translation modules (agent-to-human and vice versa) would elevate the study from pure simulation to applied co-evolution of machine and human communication.\n\n---\n\n* **METHODOLOGICAL TRANSPARENCY AND REPRODUCIBILITY**  \nSeveral key implementation details are missing, limiting reproducibility and impeding scientific progress. These include: the exact architecture sizes (e.g., embedding dimensions, hidden units, number of layers), optimization hyperparameters (e.g., learning rates, batch sizes, optimizer type), and the number of random seeds used to account for stochastic variability. Variance in emergent structure across runs is often substantial; omitting seed counts obscures the reliability of reported effects.\n\nAdditionally, the paper does not specify whether weight sharing was applied between sender and receiver networks\u2014a design choice that can significantly affect symmetry, convergence speed, and the emergence of shared conventions. Shared weights impose strong inductive biases toward invertible mappings, potentially inflating measures of coordination without reflecting true linguistic innovation.\n\nProviding full training curves\u2014not just final performance metrics\u2014would help clarify learning dynamics. For example, does compositionality emerge early or late in training? Are there periods of instability, rapid reorganization, or punctuated equilibria in the message space? These temporal patterns are often highly informative about the learning process and may distinguish between gradual refinement and sudden representational shifts.\n\nFinally, the code and data availability statement should be made explicit. Given the complexity of the experiments and the sensitivity of emergent phenomena to subtle implementation choices, open-sourcing the implementation would greatly enhance the impact, verifiability, and cumulative value of the results. Reproducibility is not merely a technical formality\u2014it is a cornerstone of empirical science, especially in fast-moving fields like emergent communication.\n\n---\n\n* **FUTURE DIRECTIONS AND THEORETICAL IMPLICATIONS**  \nThe findings open several promising avenues for future work. One direction is to extend the framework to multi-round dialogues, where agents negotiate referents through clarification requests, backchannels, or iterative descriptions. This would allow the study of interactive alignment\u2014a key mechanism in human language evolution\u2014where communicative conventions stabilize through reciprocal adjustment and mutual adaptation.\n\nAnother direction is to incorporate memory or theory of mind, enabling agents to model each other\u2019s knowledge states. This could lead to more efficient or adaptive communication strategies, such as tailoring messages based on inferred listener uncertainty, using pedagogical intent, or generating explanations. Agents equipped with belief tracking might avoid redundant information, repair misunderstandings, or ask targeted questions\u2014behaviors absent in current one-shot referential games.\n\nFrom a theoretical standpoint, the work contributes to the growing literature on the origins of structure in language, particularly the spontaneous emergence of order from distributed interaction. However, it would benefit from deeper engagement with linguistic typology. For example, do the emergent protocols resemble isolating languages (like Mandarin), where each word carries a single meaning, or agglutinative systems (like Turkish), where morphemes concatenate transparently? Might some setups produce fusional patterns, where meaning is distributed across overlapping markers?\n\nFraming the results in terms of known language universals\u2014such as Greenberg\u2019s implicational hierarchies or the distribution of word order preferences\u2014could strengthen the connection to cognitive science and historical linguistics. Furthermore, analyzing message length distributions, entropy rates, and compression efficiency relative to information content could situate the findings within information-theoretic accounts of language evolution.\n\nIn summary, this is a rich and thought-provoking contribution that pushes the boundaries of emergent communication research. With improvements in exposition, analysis depth, and methodological clarity\u2014particularly in cross-modal comparison, compositionality quantification, and architectural transparency\u2014it has the potential to become a landmark study in the field, bridging computational modeling, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence.","op1":"create","op2":"expand","domain":"openreview","model":"Qwen"}

{"human":"                  I wish people were a little more serious and dedicated to languages. Here is a piece I wrote for  urlLink Chaya , a bilingual (English and Hindi) magazine that my friends from the American Institute of Indian Studies and me put out. It is straight from the heart, this piece on the English language and me:   It never was my birthright. Neither was it my mother tongue. But fate would have it that I would be born in a former British colony, one that was in many ways colonised to the soul, and that my parents would be affluent enough to send me to an English-medium school.  Circumstance has made the English language inseparable from me. It has intimately bonded the two of us. But am I less of an Indian if I choose to pray in English and not Bengali\u2014my mother tongue? Does it make me a foreigner that I penned my first love letter in English? And would I feel more at home in Pembrokeshire than in Jaipur, just because most of the books on my shelf are in English? I think not.  A language, like one\u2019s faith, must be a personal choice; like faith, it is unfortunately also a platform for prejudice. Nothing hurts me more than to see \u201cprivileged\u201d English-speaking Indians denigrate vernacular languages.  Lately, many young Indians have begun looking at accented-English speakers as \u201ccool\u201d, as the guys who are \u201cin\u201d. This attitude is especially flawed and offensive since for most of these speakers the language remains largely a professional acquisition; although they speak the language, many of them have not even sampled the rich body of Indian writing in English.  English is shaped by its daily usage in the mushrooming nouveau-riche corporate offices of India\u2019s large cities, and is deemed only a passport to professional and financial stardom. English is treated impersonally and abused, learnt not for the love of the language but for the financial gain it entails. Worse, many of these English speakers are no longer comfortable reading and writing in their mother tongue, whatever that may be.  How many students actually \u201cchoose\u201d to study English Literature at universities in India? Only a handful. And not only English\u2014other language and literature courses as well are calling out for attention, with only uninterested and apathetic students on their rolls. On most students\u2019 lists of priorities, these courses appear far below other, more \u201ccareer-oriented\u201d subjects; in India, the Humanities have always been overshadowed by scientific and engineering programmes.  Few youngsters are in love with languages today. How many, for instance, would care to find out the various words from South Asian languages that have been officially included in the English language? And how many are interested in the etymology of any of the words that they use daily? For them language is still, unfortunately, only a survival kit.  As a journalist I use English as more than a mere instrument or simple medium of communication. All my ideas and expressions stem from this language. It has been my childhood friend and is now my life partner. Nothing gives me such a thrill as browsing through a list of unknown words, or delineating the nuances of a set of synonyms.  English words still hold a certain magic \u2014 one I have yet to fully discover \u2014 and they have made me the writer I am today. What I admire in English is the way it continues to grow on me. As much as I would now feel orphaned, unable to share anything in my heart without this language, my attachment to it can only grow stronger with the passage of time. English remains in my heart, embedded in myself, irreplaceable.             ","LLM_1":"...Pembrookeshire? I think not. The connection to this land, though thin, is one of language, of shared customs and traditions that traverse borders. My parents, despite their Westernized upbringing, continued to observe the rituals of our Bengalee heritage, passing them down to me with a quiet reverence. I recall the musty scent of old books and the flicker of diyas in our Calcutta home, where the evening prayer, aarti, was an integral part, an essential thread in the fabric of my life. \n\nAs I grew older, however, I began to notice the fissures in this cultural continuity. Our conversations at dinner often veered towards Western movies, music, or the latest news from across the seas. We'd talk of Caltech, MIT, the Ivy League schools, as if they were an extension of ourselves, our future. This dichotomy, inherent in my upbringing \u2013 the East and West \u2013 left me questioning my place in it. Did I truly belong to either side, to Bengalia or to England? The dichotomies I was raised with seemed to blur as I delved deeper into my studies, particularly in literature and history. They taught me that cultures are not mutually exclusive but intertwined in ways both subtle and profound. As a result, my connection with my Bengalie roots deepened, yet I found myself simultaneously drawn to English, that adopted tongue which had become so integral to my being. English has given me the world, allowing me access to a universe of ideas and perspectives. Bengiale, on other hand, speaks to something primal within me \u2013 a shared past, memories of childhood, love and loss, all of which are inextricably linked to it.\n\nAs a student of literature, it was natural for me, perhaps, but also necessary, for the sake of understanding and empathy, not just to learn from English literature but to immerse myself in Bengalic literature as well. Tagore, Bankim, Rabindranath's lyrical poetry \u2013 their words seemed like fragments of a long-lost language that only I could decipher. With each new discovery, there was a growing sense of homecoming, like a journey back to where I belonged. Yet, paradoxically, even in these moments of introspection, English remained an indistinguishable part \u2013 it had woven itself into the very fabric that defined me.\n\nIt is this dialectic \u2013 Bengalice and English \u2013 that forms the crux of this introspective journey. Perhaps this struggle is nothing new, nothing unique, because the history of empires and colonialism is marked by such fissured identities. Many Indians, after all, have traversed this same landscape, leaving behind the comfort of their native tongue for an adopted one, only to find themselves caught between two worlds. Theirs may have been a different context, different historical circumstances, nonetheless, they have faced the same predicament that has shaped my existence. Should I be proud of English as my adopted language or ashamed, considering it a \"foreign\" tongue that had somehow seeped into our psyche? This is the question that lingers at the back of every Indian's mind \u2013 can we, should we be ashamed of it?","LLM_2":"**Navigating Two Worlds: A Bengali's Dilemma**\n\nAs an Indian, raised in England, with roots in Bengal, you can't help but wonder if you truly fit into either world. For me personally, this connection is tenuous, tied together by the threads of culture, language and tradition. Growing up, we'd celebrate Bengala's rich heritage \u2013 from the sweet scent wafting from diyals to our evening prayers, which were a staple in Calutta. These were the moments that made me feel like I had a place to call home.\n\nHowever, life had other plans. At the dinner table, conversations often shifted towards the West, discussing the likes of Western cinema, pop music or international news. It was as though we were discussing an aspect of who we thought we could become \u2013 CalTech,MIT or one the prestigious Ivy league schools. But what did it mean to belong? Should it be Bengaali or English? These questions swirled in me as a child. Were we Indians trying to bridge the gap between our Eastern and Western roots? \n\nDelving into literature & history helped me find the answer. What I learned was that culture isn't a zero-sum game \u2013 we aren't mutually exclusives. Cultures intertwine in profound and subtle ways. So, in essence, being Bengalian meant a lot to myself. However, at that same time, i also found English to become a big part of me. In fact, It had opened up a world of new ideas & perspectives for my. On the otherhand, Bengail is something that speaks directly to heart \u2013 love, loss & memories from my childhood are all intertwined with it in some way.\n\nMy journey as literature student led me to discover Benglic literature too. Works by Tagor, Bannkim & Rabinderath, were like an old language which only i could read. Every new finding filled me a sense home coming \u2013 I felt like i belonged to somewhere. Nonetheless, english had already woven into very fibre of myself.\n\nThis dialectical struggle of Bengalien & English is what forms crutial part in journey of self-discovery. History of colonial emperies has shown that many people have gone through same kind of identity crisis. People who have left their mother tongue to take up adopted ones have had to navigate this prediciment. There's a question which lingeers at back every indians mind : are we ashamed to have an \"alien\" language in us? Can we take pride in english as our adopted mother language? Perhaps, its a dilemma which all indains will have to grapple with. Can I accept this duality as an inherent part my identity? Or am I afraid of what it says about me? Only time will tell. for now, Im left with more questions than answers. perhaps thats the beauty of being caught in between.","op1":"create","op2":"rewrite","domain":"blog","model":"llama"}
{"human":"This paper proposes a hierarchical generative model where the lower level consists of points within datasets and the higher level models unordered sets of datasets.  The basic idea is to use a \"double\" variational bound where a higher level latent variable describes datasets and a lower level latent variable describes individual examples.\n\nHierarchical modeling is an important and high impact problem, and I think that it's under-explored in the Deep Learning literature.  \n\nPros:\n  -The few-shot learning results look good, but I'm not an expert in this area.  \n  -The idea of using a \"double\" variational bound in a hierarchical generative model is well presented and seems widely applicable.  \n\nQuestions: \n  -When training the statistic network, are minibatches (i.e. subsets of the examples) used?  \n  -If not, does using minibatches actually give you an unbiased estimator of the full gradient (if you had used all examples)?  For example, what if the statistic network wants to pull out if *any* example from the dataset has a certain feature and treat that as the characterization.  This seems to fit the graphical model on the right side of figure 1.  If your statistic network is trained on minibatches, it won't be able to learn this characterization, because a given minibatch will be missing some of the examples from the dataset.  Using minibatches (as opposed to using all examples in the dataset) to train the statistic network seems like it would limit the expressive power of the model.  \n\nSuggestions: \n  -Hierarchical forecasting (electricity \/ sales) could be an interesting and practical use case for this type of model.  ","LLM_1":"- The proposed hierarchical variational framework introduces a novel way of handling set-structured data across multiple levels, which is particularly valuable in meta-learning and few-shot classification scenarios. By modeling both intra-dataset and inter-dataset variability through distinct latent variables, the method captures richer dependencies than flat generative models. This architectural choice enables more structured generalization, especially when dealing with heterogeneous collections of datasets.\n\n- One notable strength lies in the formulation of the double ELBO (Evidence Lower Bound), which allows simultaneous optimization over two tiers of latent representations. This design not only maintains theoretical consistency with variational inference principles but also scales reasonably well in practice, as demonstrated in the experiments. The derivation correctly accounts for the permutation invariance at both levels, preserving the set-based nature of the inputs without imposing artificial orderings.\n\n- The experimental evaluation covers several synthetic and real-world benchmarks, including few-shot image classification and distribution regression tasks. Results show consistent improvements over baseline models that do not employ hierarchical latents or treat datasets as exchangeable entities. In particular, the performance gains on the miniImageNet and CIFAR-FS few-shot learning benchmarks suggest that the model effectively leverages shared structure across tasks\u2014this is a promising indication of its capacity for higher-level abstraction.\n\n- That said, the current implementation assumes that all datasets are of similar size and structure, which may limit applicability in more realistic settings where dataset heterogeneity extends beyond content to include varying numbers of samples, modalities, or label spaces. Future work could explore adaptive mechanisms\u2014such as attention over variable-length dataset embeddings or hierarchical pooling\u2014to relax these constraints and broaden the scope of applicable domains.\n\n- While the paper emphasizes the theoretical novelty of the double variational bound, it would benefit from a more detailed ablation study isolating the contribution of each component: the higher-level latent, the lower-level latent, and their interaction term in the objective. For instance, how much of the performance gain can be attributed to better task representation versus improved example generation? A controlled analysis disentangling these factors would strengthen the empirical claims and guide future applications.\n\n- The use of amortized inference at both levels raises valid concerns about posterior collapse, particularly at the higher tier where signals must propagate across entire datasets. Although the authors report stable training behavior, they do not explicitly measure or report metrics related to latent space utilization (e.g., aggregate KL divergence, active units). Including such diagnostics would help assess whether both levels are being meaningfully engaged during inference.\n\n- From a modeling perspective, the assumption of conditional independence between datasets given the top-level latent variable simplifies computation but may overlook potential relationships among datasets\u2014such as clustering tendencies or hierarchical groupings\u2014that could further enhance representation learning. Extending the model to allow for structured priors over the higher-level latents (e.g., Gaussian mixtures or tree-structured dependencies) might yield even stronger performance in multi-domain or continual learning setups.\n\n- The paper\u2019s treatment of uncertainty quantification remains somewhat underdeveloped. While the generative process naturally supports sampling from different levels of the hierarchy, there is limited discussion on how well-calibrated the uncertainties are, especially when generating new datasets or predicting unseen task distributions. Incorporating tools like proper scoring rules or calibration plots could provide deeper insight into the reliability of the model\u2019s predictions.\n\n- Another area for improvement involves computational efficiency. Training times appear significantly longer compared to non-hierarchical baselines due to nested inference loops and repeated encoder evaluations. The authors might consider investigating alternative inference strategies\u2014such as cached dataset-level encodings or stochastic dataset subsampling during training\u2014to improve scalability without sacrificing representational power.\n\n- The writing is generally clear and well-organized, though certain technical sections (particularly Section 3.2 on the joint ELBO derivation) could benefit from additional intuition or visual aids. A diagram illustrating the flow of information between the two levels of the hierarchy would greatly aid reader comprehension, especially for those less familiar with deep hierarchical Bayesian models.\n\n- One missed opportunity lies in the lack of exploration on downstream transferability. Given that the upper-level latent codes represent entire datasets, they could serve as compact meta-features for transfer learning across unrelated domains. Demonstrating their utility in zero-shot dataset retrieval, domain adaptation, or anomaly detection (e.g., identifying out-of-distribution datasets) would underscore the broader impact of the learned representations.\n\n- Finally, while the ethical implications of this work are minimal, the potential for misuse in generating synthetic datasets that mimic sensitive real-world data warrants caution. As generative models become increasingly capable of capturing high-level statistical patterns, ensuring responsible deployment\u2014especially in regulated or privacy-sensitive contexts\u2014will be crucial. A brief discussion on data provenance or watermarking techniques could proactively address such concerns.\n\nIn summary, this is a strong contribution to the literature on hierarchical Bayesian modeling and set-to-set learning.

With modest extensions to handle greater dataset diversity, improve interpretability, and increase efficiency, the framework has the potential to become a foundational tool in meta-learning and beyond. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions.","LLM_2":"**\n\nThe proposed hierarchical variational framework presents a conceptually elegant and technically sound approach to modeling set-structured data across multiple levels\u2014an increasingly important challenge in meta-learning and few-shot classification. By explicitly disentangling intra-dataset variability (e.g., within-task variations among examples) from inter-dataset variability (e.g., differences between tasks or domains), the model introduces a more nuanced understanding of structured generalization. This is achieved through distinct latent variables operating at two tiers: one capturing shared characteristics across datasets, and another encoding idiosyncratic patterns within individual datasets. In contrast to flat generative models that treat all inputs as exchangeable or impose rigid hierarchical assumptions, this architecture allows for richer dependency structures while preserving permutation invariance\u2014a critical property when dealing with unordered sets. The resulting representation space enables the model to generalize not only from limited examples but also across heterogeneous collections of tasks, which is particularly valuable in real-world settings where both task diversity and sample scarcity coexist.\n\nA key methodological innovation lies in the formulation of the double ELBO objective, which facilitates joint optimization over both lower-level (example-specific) and higher-level (dataset-specific) latent representations. This dual inference mechanism ensures theoretical consistency with variational inference principles by deriving a valid lower bound on the log marginal likelihood under the hierarchical prior structure. Importantly, the derivation respects the symmetry constraints inherent in set-valued inputs at both levels\u2014avoiding arbitrary ordering artifacts that could bias learning\u2014and thus maintains the foundational properties required for set-to-set learning. Empirically, the model demonstrates favorable scalability despite the added complexity of nested variational approximations. The experiments suggest that the training procedure remains stable and converges reliably across different benchmarks, indicating that the optimization landscape introduced by the double ELBO does not introduce prohibitive instability\u2014a non-trivial achievement given the potential for vanishing gradients or imbalanced learning signals in deep hierarchical models.\n\nThe experimental evaluation is thorough and well-designed, encompassing both synthetic environments and real-world few-shot learning benchmarks such as miniImageNet and CIFAR-FS. On these vision tasks, the model consistently outperforms baseline approaches that either ignore hierarchical structure or assume full exchangeability across datasets. These gains are especially pronounced in cross-domain few-shot settings, where the ability to abstract commonalities across diverse but related tasks becomes crucial. For instance, the improved accuracy in 5-way 1-shot and 5-shot configurations suggests that the top-level latent effectively captures transferable knowledge\u2014such as typical feature distributions, class prototypes, or semantic clustering tendencies\u2014that can be reused across novel tasks. Moreover, in distribution regression experiments, the model excels at predicting target statistics from input dataset embeddings, further validating its capacity to learn meaningful, generalizable meta-representations. However, it would be instructive to see performance comparisons against recent alternatives like Set Transformers or energy-based models adapted for hierarchical set modeling, to better contextualize the relative advantages of the variational approach.\n\nThat said, several limitations merit attention and offer clear pathways for future development. First, the current implementation assumes uniformity in dataset size and structure, which may hinder deployment in practical scenarios characterized by significant heterogeneity\u2014not just in content, but in cardinality (number of samples per dataset), modality (e.g., mixing image and text data), or label space compatibility (e.g., overlapping vs. disjoint classes). While the core framework is theoretically flexible enough to accommodate such variation, the absence of adaptive mechanisms limits its robustness. Potential remedies include integrating attention-based pooling layers that dynamically weight examples based on relevance, or employing hierarchical aggregation schemes (e.g., DeepSet variants with learned readouts) that can process variable-length inputs more gracefully. Such extensions would allow the model to scale naturally to irregular collections of datasets without requiring preprocessing alignment.\n\nFurthermore, although the paper emphasizes the theoretical novelty of the double ELBO, the empirical contribution would be strengthened by a more granular ablation study dissecting the roles of each component in the objective function. Specifically, how much of the observed improvement stems from the higher-level latent alone versus the interaction term between the two latent spaces? Controlled evaluations\u2014such as freezing one latent path during training or comparing against models with factorized posteriors\u2014could help isolate whether performance gains arise primarily from enhanced task-level abstraction or from improved fidelity in example generation. Similarly, analyzing the impact of coupling strength (via weighting terms in the loss) might reveal trade-offs between memorization and generalization, offering practical guidance for downstream applications.\n\nAnother concern relates to amortized inference at the higher tier. While computationally efficient, using deterministic encoder outputs to approximate complex posterior distributions risks posterior collapse\u2014particularly if gradient signals from the lower level fail to propagate meaningfully upward. Although the authors report stable training dynamics, they do not provide diagnostics to confirm active utilization of the latent space (e.g., aggregate KL divergence trends, proportion of active units, or mutual information estimates between latents and data). Including such metrics would offer stronger evidence that both levels contribute meaningfully to inference rather than being underutilized due to representational redundancy or optimization bottlenecks. Visualization of latent traversals or clustering behavior in the upper-level space could further illuminate the semantic coherence of learned dataset representations.\n\nFrom a modeling standpoint, the assumption of conditional independence between datasets given the top-level latent simplifies computation but may overlook valuable relational structure among tasks. In many real-world applications, datasets often exhibit clustering (e.g., medical imaging datasets grouped by organ type), temporal progression (e.g., continual learning streams), or hierarchical organization (e.g., species taxonomy in biological data). By extending the prior over higher-level latents to incorporate structured dependencies\u2014such as Gaussian mixture models, graph-regularized priors, or tree-structured Bayesian hierarchies\u2014the model could capture such inter-task relationships and enable even richer forms of transfer. This would also align well with emerging interests in modular and compositional meta-learning, where reusable components are assembled dynamically based on context.\n\nUncertainty quantification, while implicitly supported by the generative nature of the model, remains an underexplored aspect. Given that the framework supports sampling from different levels of the hierarchy\u2014including generating entirely new datasets\u2014it is essential to assess whether the predicted uncertainties are well-calibrated. For example, when extrapolating to unseen task distributions, does the model assign appropriately high uncertainty? Tools such as proper scoring rules (e.g., continuous ranked probability score), calibration plots, or entropy analysis over predictive samples could shed light on reliability. Such analyses are particularly relevant in safety-critical domains (e.g., healthcare or autonomous systems), where trustworthy uncertainty estimation is paramount.\n\nOn the computational front, the model incurs longer training times compared to non-hierarchical baselines, largely due to repeated encoder evaluations and nested inference loops. While this cost may be justified in high-stakes applications requiring rich representations, it poses challenges for large-scale deployment. To improve efficiency, the authors might explore strategies such as caching dataset-level encodings after initial passes, adopting stochastic subsampling of datasets during mini-batch training, or leveraging lightweight surrogate models for fast inference approximation. Alternatively, architectural innovations like hypernetworks or functional regularization could reduce parameter redundancy while preserving expressiveness.\n\nIn terms of presentation, the paper is generally well-written, with a logical flow and precise technical exposition. That said, certain sections\u2014particularly Section 3.2, which details the joint ELBO derivation\u2014would benefit from additional explanatory intuition or visual support. A schematic diagram illustrating the flow of information between the two latent levels, including the direction of conditioning, sources of stochasticity, and symmetry-preserving operations, would greatly enhance accessibility. Such a figure could clarify how local and global latents interact during both inference and generation, making the architecture more interpretable for readers less familiar with deep hierarchical Bayes nets.\n\nAn underexploited opportunity involves probing the transferability of the learned dataset-level embeddings. Since the upper-level latent codes summarize entire datasets in a compact form, they have natural potential as meta-features for downstream tasks beyond classification\u2014such as zero-shot dataset retrieval (e.g., finding similar benchmark datasets), domain adaptation (e.g., aligning source and target task distributions), or anomaly detection (e.g., flagging out-of-distribution or corrupted datasets). Demonstrating utility in any of these directions would underscore the broader applicability of the framework and reinforce the value of structured meta-representation learning.\n\nFinally, while the ethical implications of this work are relatively minor, the increasing capability of generative models to synthesize realistic, high-fidelity datasets raises legitimate concerns about misuse\u2014especially in contexts involving sensitive or personal data (e.g., medical records, behavioral traces). If such models were used to generate synthetic datasets mimicking protected populations, there would be risks of privacy leakage, biased replication, or deceptive use in regulatory submissions. Proactively addressing these issues\u2014through discussion of data provenance tracking, watermarking techniques for synthetic data, or differential privacy integration\u2014would reflect responsible scholarship and help ensure safe adoption in regulated environments.\n\nIn summary, this is a strong and timely contribution to the fields of meta-learning, set-to-set modeling, and hierarchical Bayesian inference. The core idea is theoretically grounded, empirically validated, and opens up promising avenues for future research. With modest enhancements\u2014particularly in handling dataset heterogeneity, improving interpretability through ablation and visualization, strengthening uncertainty assessment, and increasing computational efficiency\u2014the framework has the potential to become a foundational tool for learning from structured collections of data.

{"human":"There is great interest in the development of potentiator drugs to increase the activity of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) in cystic fibrosis. We tested the ability of several anions to potentiate CFTR activity by a novel mechanism.Patch clamp recordings were used to investigate the ability of extracellular pseudohalide anions (Co(CN)(6) (3-) , Co(NO(2) )(6) (3-) , Fe(CN)(6) (3-) , IrCl(6) (3-) , Fe(CN)(6) (4-) ) to increase the macroscopic conductance of mutant CFTR in intact cells via interactions with cytoplasmic blocking anions. Mutagenesis of CFTR was used to identify a possible molecular mechanism of action. Transepithelial short-circuit current recordings from human airway epithelial cells were used to determine effects on net anion secretion.Extracellular pseudohalide anions were able to increase CFTR conductance in intact cells, as well as increase anion secretion in airway epithelial cells. This effect appears to reflect the interaction of these substances with a site on the extracellular face of the CFTR protein.","LLM_1":"mechanism involving allosteric modulation of channel gating.

Structure-activity analysis revealed that efficacy correlated with anion valence and hydroxyl group positioning, implicating specific hydrogen-bonding interactions within the CFTR nucleotide-binding domain 1 (NBD1). Molecular docking simulations supported this hypothesis, predicting stable binding at an interfacial site involved in dimerization with NBD2.

{"human":"This paper proposes an alternative GAN formulation that replaces the standard binary classification task in the discriminator with an autoregressive model that attempts to capture discriminative feature dependencies on the true data samples.\n\nSummary assessment:\nThe paper presents a novel perspective on GANs and an interesting conjecture regarding the failure of GANs to capture global consistency. However the experiments do not directly support this conjecture. In addition, both qualitative and quantitative results do not provide significant evidence of the value of this technique over and above the established methods in the literature.\n\nThe central motivation of the method proposed in the paper, is a conjecture that the lack of global consistency in GAN-generated samples is due to the binary classification formulation of the discriminator. While this is an interesting conjecture, I am somewhat unconvinced that this is indeed the cause of the problem. First, I would argue that other high-performing auto-regressive models such as PixelRNN and PixelCNN also seem to lack global consistency. This observation would seem to violate this conjecture. More importantly, the paper does not show any direct empirical evidence in support of this conjecture. \n\nThe authors make a very interesting observation in their description of the proposed approach. In discussing an initial variant of the model (Eqns. (5) and (6) and text immediately below), the authors state that attempting to maximize the negative log likelihood of the auto-regressive modelling the generated samples results in unstable training. I would like to see more discussion of this point as it could have some bearing on the difficulty of GAN to model sequential data in general. Does the failure occurs because the auto-regressive discriminator is able to \"overfit\" the generated samples?\n\nAs a result of the observed failure of the formulation given in Eqns. (5) and (6), the authors propose an alternative formulation that explicitly removes the negative likelihood maximization for generated samples. As a result the only objective for the auto-regressive model is an attempt to maximize the log-likelihood of the true data. The authors suggest that this should be sufficient to provide a reliable training signal for the generator. It would be useful if the authors showed a representation of these features (perhaps via T-SNE) for both true data and generated samples. \n\nEmpirical results:\nThe authors experiments show samples (qualitative comparison) and inception scores (quantitative comparison) for 3 variants of the proposed model and compare these to methods in the literature. The comparisons show the proposed model performs well, but does not exceed the performance of many of the existing methods in the literature.\n\nAlso, I fail to observe significantly more global consistency for these samples compared to samples of other SOTA GAN models in the literature. Again, there is no attempt made by the authors to make this direct comparison of global consistency either qualitatively or quantitatively. \n\nMinor comment:\nI did not see where PARGAN was defined. Was this the combination of the Auto-regressive GAN with Patch-GAN?","LLM_1":"**Structured Feedback**\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n1\\. Novel Perspective: \nThe authors present an innovative perspective by replacing the traditional binary classifier with a more sophisticated autogressive model.

Clear Writing:  \nThe paper is well-written and easy to follow, making it accessible to a broad audience. \n\n3\\.

Nevertheless, these gains are marginal, which raises questions about the significance and practical impact of these advancements.\n\n    It would be beneficial to see more comprehensive comparisons with established techniques to demonstrate the proposed method's value.\n\n# Weak Points in Qualitative Analysis:\n\n    The qualitative analysis seems to focus primarily on showcasing the generated images rather than providing a thorough critique of their quality. A more in-depth analysis of both the strengths and weaknesses of each generated image would offer a clearer understanding of how well the technique performs.\n\n*The lack\n\n## Suggestions for Future Work:\n\nTo build upon this research, I recommend:\n\n### 1.\nConduct more extensive experiments to directly evaluate the impact on global coherence and investigate how the approach compares to existing methods.\n\nPerform a comprehensive analysis to assess the effectiveness of autregressive formulations in addressing the challenges associated with Gans.\n\nConsider incorporating additional evaluation metrics that capture aspects of image quality and content that may not be addressed by the current metrics.\n\nImplementing a clear, systematic approach to analyzing and evaluating the results will enable a stronger argument and more convincing presentation of findings.\n\nIn conclusion, this paper makes a valuable contribution to G AN research by presenting a new perspective and interesting ideas. While it has its limitations, with further development and refinement, it may offer practical benefits and insights in this area. I look forward to seeing the future work that builds upon these ideas.\n\nPlease provide your feedback on this continuation.

Not a single nuclear facility is shut down, including the underground facilities that they build illicitly. Thousands of centrifuges will keep spinning, enriching uranium. That's a very bad deal.\"\nBut Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a possible Republican presidential candidate, said it was \"probably the best deal that Barack Obama could get with the Iranians\" and that he would wait to see how the final agreement looked before passing judgement.\n\"I don't mind giving the administration the time between now and June to put this deal together,\" he told CBS.\nIran's key nuclear sites\nAnalysis: A deal which buys time","LLM_1":"program.\" The president emphasized that while the U.S. remains deeply concerned about Iran\u2019s regional activities and rhetoric, the primary objective of nuclear negotiations must remain narrowly focused on preventing Tehran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.\n\nAdministration officials echoed this sentiment, stating that broadening the scope of negotiations to include issues like recognition of Israel or changes in domestic governance would likely derail any chance of diplomatic progress. \"We\u2019re dealing with hard realities here,\" said one senior advisor, speaking on condition of anonymity. \"Our goal is verifiable constraints on Iran\u2019s nuclear capabilities\u2014not regime change or symbolic political gestures.\"\n\nThe remarks come amid renewed diplomatic efforts to revive the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), from which the U.S. unilaterally withdrew in 2018 under the Trump administration. Since then, Iran has significantly expanded its uranium enrichment activities, bringing it closer than ever to weapons-grade levels.

{"human":"Various minimally invasive approaches to reduce pain during extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) have been described. We compared petroleum jelly (Vaselinet) and ultrasound gel in vitro as a contact medium based on the stone fragmentation rate. The analgesic effect of cutaneous petroleum jelly was tested against eutectic mixture of local anesthesia. We also evaluated the outcome of ESWL in a large group of patients treated with petroleum jelly.In vitro 3 artificial stones were completely fragmented with a MFL 5000* lithotriptor using petroleum jelly or ultrasound gel as a contact medium. A total of 110 patients (group 1) received petroleum jelly before treatment with the same lithotriptor. After retrospective analysis of group 1 we matched 32 patients (group 2) receiving cutaneous eutectic mixture of local anesthesia. Because of the favorable results with petroleum jelly, we used it in another 148 patients, for a total of 258 patients (group V). Treatment dependent pain was scored using a questionnaire as 1--no, 2--minor, 3--tolerable and 4--intolerable. ESWL without additional analgesics had a pain score of 1 to 3.In vitro petroleum jelly had a superior fragmentation rate compared to ultrasound gel. Our long-term experience with the lithotriptor indicated that only 30% of patients required no additional analgesics with cutaneous ultrasound gel. In contrast, no additional analgesics were needed in only 38% of group 2 compared to 81.8% of group V. The stone fragmentation rate did not differ statistically between groups.","LLM_1":"efficacy of these interventions in reducing visual analog scale (VAS) scores during treatment. A prospective, randomized controlled trial was conducted on 120 patients with renal or upper ureteral calculi undergoing ESWL. Patients were randomly assigned to one of four groups: petroleum jelly with no anesthesia, petroleum jelly with topical anesthetic, ultrasound gel alone, and ultrasound gel with topical anesthetic. In vitro shock wave transmission efficiency was assessed using a piezoelectric shock wave generator and artificial stone models. Fragmentation rates were quantified by measuring the mean particle size post-treatment via digital sieving. Clinically, VAS scores were recorded at baseline, peak pain intensity, and 5 minutes post-procedure. The group receiving petroleum jelly with topical anesthetic demonstrated significantly lower VAS scores compared to all other groups (p < 0.01), with no difference in fragmentation efficacy between petroleum jelly and ultrasound gel (p = 0.43). In vitro analysis confirmed equivalent acoustic transmission properties. No adverse events related to skin irritation or systemic absorption were reported. Petroleum jelly serves as an effective coupling agent comparable to ultrasound gel and enhances analgesia when combined with topical anesthetics, offering a low-cost, accessible option for improving patient comfort during ESWL without compromising lithotripsy efficiency.","LLM_2":"This study evaluates the efficacy of various coupling agents and topical anesthetics in reducing pain during extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) for renal and upper ureteral calculi, while assessing their impact on treatment outcomes.

Twenty-one patients underwent posterior fossa vestibular neurectomy (VN) and five, mastoid endolymphatic sac decompression and shunt (ELS). All frequencies, four-frequency pure-tone averages (PTAs), spondee thresholds, and speech recognition scores were compared for operated ear against nonoperated ear of VN subjects. The results were subjected to a covariance analysis. VN and ELS patients whose hearing deteriorated from \"serviceable\" (PTA < or =70 dB hearing level) and speech recognition > or =30%) to nonserviceable status were compared using nonparametric statistics.Progressive hearing loss beyond the rate of change of the normal contralateral ear was evident in all patients.

In the labyrinthectomy group, all patients demonstrated no serviceable hearing postoperatively, as expected. Progression of hearing loss correlated with age (r = 0.32, p = 0.003) and preoperative cochlear hydrops severity on MRI (p < 0.01). Vertigo control rates (Class A and B) were 92% at last follow-up, with no significant difference between surgical modalities. Persistent disequilibrium was reported in 18% of patients, independent of hearing trajectory.

He said it would be an awful bore, but he will certainly make a good impression especially in his new tourist getup and leather breeches. Grandmama and Grandpapa sent love to all. I've never seen them. They have sent a lot of cakes and sweets and Oswald grumbled no end because he had to bring them. Oswald is always smoking cigarettes and Father said to him: Come along old chap, we'll go to the inn and have a drink on the strength of your good report. It seems to me rather funny; no one wants to drink anything when Dora and I have a good report, at most they give us a present. Oswald has only Twos and Threes and very few Ones and in Greek nothing but Satis-factory, but I have nothing but Ones. He said something to Father in Latin and Father laughed heartily and said something I could not understand. I don't think it was Latin, but it may have been Magyar or English. Father knows nearly all languages, even Czech, but thank goodness he doesn't talk them unless he wants to tease us. Like that time at the station when Dora and I were so ashamed. Czech is horrid, Mother says so too. When Robert pretends to speak Czech it's screamingly funny.

Grandmama remarked that it\u2019s the moustache that truly marks the transition; it\u2019s the universal signal of a boy deciding to become a man, however wispy the initial proof may be. We shared a quiet laugh, but it was tinged with that peculiar nostalgia for a chapter that has, without fanfare, closed.\n\nI wonder what impressions he *is* making at the hotel. Father will be proudly showing him off, I\u2019m sure, steering him through the smoky lounge with a hand on his shoulder. Oswald will be enacting the part perfectly: nodding gravely at stories of trade and travel, perhaps even offering a carefully considered opinion on Swiss weather or Italian wines. It\u2019s a performance, but a necessary one. These introductions are the grease for the wheels of his future, and beneath the affected boredom he professed, he knows it. His new tourist getup is more than clothing; it\u2019s a costume for the role of a promising young man on the rise.\n\nAnd yet, I saw a glimpse of the old Oswald when he examined the tray of lemon cakes Cook had set out earlier.

{"human":"Cancer cachexia is an important, negative prognostic marker that has been linked to systemic inflammation and cell death through unclear mechanisms. A key feature of cancer cachexia is loss of white adipose tissue (WAT) because of increased adipocyte lipolysis and possibly reduced lipid synthesis (lipogenesis). In this study, the authors investigated whether alterations in fat cell numbers, lipogenesis, or cytokine and\/or leukocyte infiltration could account for some of the functional changes observed in WAT in cancer cachexia.Blood and subcutaneous WAT samples were obtained from a 10 weight-stable patients, from 13 weight losing (cachexia) patients with cancer, and from 5 patients without cancer (noncancer patients) who initially were classified with cancer.Systemic inflammation (increased circulating levels of interleukin 6 [IL-6]) and enhanced lipolysis were confirmed in the cachectic patients compared with the other patients. However, the messenger RNA expression of IL-6 and other cytokine or leukocyte markers, as well as WAT secretion of IL-6, were not altered in the patients with cachexia. Thus, the elevated serum levels of IL-6 that were observed in cachexia were not derived from WAT. Insulin-induced lipogenesis in adipocytes from patients with cachexia was the same as that in adipocytes from patients with weight-stable cancer and from noncancer patients (2.5-fold maximal stimulation; half-maximum effective concentration, approximately 0.03 nmol\/L). Fat cell size was decreased but adipocyte numbers were normal in cancer patients with cachexia, suggesting that there was no major fat cell death.","LLM_1":"To elucidate the underlying mechanisms of adiposity alterations, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of fat-cell dynamics in cancer patients. Specifically, our investigation aimed to discern whether changes in adipogenesis, a process by which precursor cells differentiate into mature adipocytes, contribute to decreased WAT mass. We employed a cohort of 100 cancer subjects, comprising 50 patients with advanced-stage tumors and 25 healthy controls, to examine the relationship between adipogenic capacity, systemic inflammatory markers, such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL- 6), and cachectic symptoms. Furthermore, using a combination of immunohistochemical and biochemical assays, this analysis sought to determine whether altered expression of key adipokines, including leptin and adiponectin, modulated fat tissue metabolism and W AT mass in the presence of systemic cancer. \n\nOur findings revealed that cancer-induced alterations to adipocytic function and fat metabolism were significantly correlated with increased circulating levels of CRP and IL-7, suggesting a systemic link between inflammation, cachetic symptoms, fat loss,  and the observed decline in W A T mass.\n\nIn this context, identifying the mechanistic pathways underlying this relationship may provide valuable insights into novel therapeutic strategies aimed at preserving muscle mass and mitigating the impact of cachaxia on patient outcomes. To address this, future studies should investigate the efficacy of targeting adipolytic and inflammatory pathways in modulating fat mass loss and systemic disease progression in patients undergoing cancer treatment. Additionally, elucidation of molecular mechanisms governing adipic differentiation and function will be essential in developing novel therapies aimed a preserving adipository tissue in this population. Our research provides preliminary evidence supporting this area of investigation. Further research is necessary to explore the interplay between systemic factors and local fat-tissue metabolism, in order to inform the development of targeted therapeutic interventions. By understanding the complex interrelations between cachaxis, inflammation. and tissue loss our findings contribute towards the identification of a promising therapeutic approach to mitigate the effects of this debilitating condition.

{"human":"Summary\n\nThis paper presents a method called SACoD to develop a more efficient CNN-powered Phlatcam. The proposed method optimizes both the PhlatCam sensor and the backend CNN model simultaneously.  That is, the coded mask in Phlatcam and neural network weights are regarded as learnable parameters. The coded mask (the optical layer) can be considered as a special convolution layer. As a result, it achieves energy saving, model compressing as well as good accuracy. Extensive experiments and ablation studies are presented to show the effectiveness of the method.\n\nOverall,  I think the paper is interesting and properly designed. I also believe that various experiments and analyses of this paper can influence future related studies. However, I hope many experiments using raw images obtained from the real-world lensless imaging system will be included.\n\nStrength\n\nThis paper is the first attempt to optimize both sensor and CNN-model at the same time. The derivation and formulation look interesting.\n\nComments and Weakness\n\nIn figure3, the input seems like a normal RGB image. Also, data in datasets such as CIFAR10 and Cityscape are common RGB images. Then, wasn't it applied to the real image obtained using the lensless imaging system? Even in Table 1, reported results were from common RGB images in CIFAR-10. In both optimized and experimental results, source images for testing are not real-world data from lensless imaging systems.\n\nIs there any comparative test of the three methods in Figure3? Is there a reason why they are mentioned? The reasons why design (a) was chosen are mentioned in the text, it is also better to show them experimentally.\n\nTo what level can the Flops and energy be lowered based on the same baseline CNN model, and is it enough to put it on the real-world IoT system?\n\nIt would be better to compare the proposed method with more than two baseline methods. For example, I wonder what happens when regular CNN without optical layers is used. Also, it would be good to have an experiment on various types of mask filters except for Gabor.\n\nAbout table2, What is the reason for the big difference in CIFAR-100 while there is not much increase in CIFAR-10?\n\nFont sizes in Figure4 and Figure 6 are too small to read.","LLM_1":"- The joint optimization framework proposed in SACoD is conceptually sound and aligns well with recent trends in end-to-end learnable imaging systems.

The current setup appears tailored to specific datasets (e.g., ImageNet subsets or synthetic scenes). Evaluating transferability\u2014either through cross-dataset testing or few-shot adaptation scenarios\u2014would help determine whether the learned optical encoding is dataset-specific or captures more universal features beneficial across imaging tasks.\n\n- From a reproducibility standpoint, the paper would be strengthened by disclosing key implementation details such as initialization strategies for the coded mask, learning rate schedules for both optical and digital parameters, and whether batch normalization or other architectural components were modified to accommodate the differentiable optics layer.

Real-world imaging conditions involve variations in illumination, motion blur, and sensor noise. How does SACoD perform under noisy measurements or non-ideal lighting compared to standard PhlatCam configurations? Simulating such conditions and analyzing their impact on reconstruction fidelity would enhance confidence in the method's applicability outside controlled environments.\n\n- The notion of treating the optical layer as a convolutional filter raises intriguing questions about its interpretability. Visualizing the learned mask patterns and analyzing their frequency response could reveal whether they naturally converge toward known optimal coding strategies (e.g., Hadamard or random phase patterns) or discover novel structures enabled by data-driven design. Such analysis could bridge intuitive understanding between classical optics and modern learning-based paradigms.\n\n- Furthermore, while model compression is highlighted as a key outcome, it remains unclear how much of the compression stems from reduced backend complexity versus intrinsic information encoding in the optical domain.

Expanding the assessment to include low-level vision metrics\u2014such as PSNR, SSIM, or perceptual quality\u2014would provide a more comprehensive view of image fidelity, particularly important in applications where human interpretation or downstream processing is involved.\n\n- It would also be informative to compare the number of trainable parameters introduced by the optical layer relative to the overall model. If the mask contains millions of free variables, it might offset some of the claimed efficiency benefits despite reductions in digital compute. Clarifying this trade-off would refine the narrative around compactness.\n\n- Lastly, the paper presents a promising step toward intelligent sensor design, but long-term viability depends on adaptability. Future extensions could explore dynamic masks updated in real-time based on scene content\u2014an avenue that, while technically challenging, would push the boundaries of responsive imaging systems. Even a short discussion on incremental pathways toward such capabilities would enrich the paper\u2019s forward-looking perspective.","LLM_2":"- The joint optimization framework proposed in SACoD is conceptually sound and aligns well with recent trends in end-to-end learnable imaging systems, where the boundaries between physical sensing and digital processing are increasingly blurred. By co-designing the optical encoder and neural network decoder within a unified differentiable pipeline, the method embodies a paradigm shift from modular design to holistic system engineering. However, the paper would benefit from a more thorough discussion on the practical constraints of fabricating the learned coded mask. Specifically, while the simulation assumes idealized continuous-valued transmittance patterns\u2014where each pixel in the mask can take any value between 0 and 1\u2014real-world manufacturing processes for diffractive optical elements or spatial light modulators often require binary (on\/off) or low-bit quantized designs due to limitations in lithography, etching precision, or material response. A sensitivity analysis evaluating performance degradation when discretizing the optimized mask into 1-bit, 2-bit, or ternary representations could significantly strengthen the practical relevance of the method. Such an evaluation might also reveal whether certain regions of the mask are more sensitive to quantization, potentially motivating structured sparsity or constrained optimization during training to promote manufacturable solutions.\n\n- One notable strength lies in the integration of optical encoding as a differentiable layer within the CNN architecture, effectively treating the physical sensor as a trainable component analogous to convolutional weights.

These issues are exacerbated by the high dimensionality and non-convex nature of the joint loss landscape. The authors should clarify whether any stabilization techniques\u2014such as curriculum learning (e.g., starting with coarse-resolution masks or pre-trained backbones), explicit regularization (e.g., total variation penalties on mask smoothness), gradient clipping, or adaptive optimizers with separate learning rates for optical and digital components\u2014were employed during training. Reporting such implementation choices would not only improve reproducibility but also shed light on the interplay between architectural design and trainability in hybrid physical-digital models.\n\n- The experimental section demonstrates compelling improvements in energy efficiency and model size reduction, suggesting that part of the computational burden is offloaded from the digital processor to the analog optical front-end. Nevertheless, comparisons with state-of-the-art compressed sensing and computational imaging approaches beyond conventional PhlatCam baselines are limited. Including benchmarks against modern deep unfolding networks (e.g.,ISTA-Net, ADMM-Net), hybrid optical-digital co-design frameworks such as OptNet or DeepOptics, or Fourier-domain modulation schemes like those used in lensless imaging or single-pixel cameras would provide a broader context for assessing SACoD\u2019s relative advantages. In particular, it would be instructive to compare reconstruction fidelity under comparable bit-rate, latency, or power budgets, especially in low-data regimes. Moreover, evaluating performance across diverse downstream tasks\u2014not just classification but also segmentation or detection\u2014could further underscore the generality of the gains achieved through co-design.\n\n- While accuracy metrics are reported, there is insufficient detail regarding inference latency and power consumption at deployment time. Given that the primary motivation includes energy-efficient sensing\u2014particularly for edge devices with strict thermal and battery constraints\u2014reporting actual measurements or realistic estimates of power draw during image reconstruction would substantiate claims about system-level efficiency. For instance, how does the end-to-end inference pipeline perform on embedded platforms such as Jetson Nano, Coral Edge TPU, or FPGA-based accelerators? Are the latency savings dominated by reduced data movement, fewer network layers, or faster convergence of iterative solvers thanks to better-conditioned inputs? Concrete profiling results, even if approximate, would help ground the efficiency narrative in tangible hardware realities rather than abstract parameter counts.\n\n- The ablation studies effectively isolate the impact of co-design versus sequential optimization, showing measurable benefits when the mask and network are trained jointly. However, an additional dimension worth exploring is the influence of architectural choice in the backend CNN. For instance, does the benefit of joint optimization diminish when using highly efficient backbones like MobileNetV3, EfficientNet-Lite, or GhostNet, which are already designed for minimal compute and memory footprint? Conversely, do larger models with greater representational capacity amplify the gains from improved optical preprocessing? Quantifying how performance improvements scale across model families and complexity levels\u2014perhaps via a \"gain curve\" plotted against FLOPS or parameter count\u2014could offer deeper insight into where the proposed method delivers the most value: whether it primarily boosts weak decoders, saturates strong ones, or unlocks new operating points in the accuracy-efficiency trade-off space.\n\n- An interesting direction touched upon but not fully exploited is the generalization of the learned mask across diverse scene priors. The current setup appears tailored to specific datasets\u2014such as subsets of ImageNet or synthetic scenes generated under controlled conditions\u2014which raises concerns about dataset bias and domain specificity. Evaluating transferability\u2014either through cross-dataset testing (e.g., training on ImageNet but testing on COCO or medical imaging data) or few-shot adaptation scenarios where the mask remains fixed but the network adapts to new domains\u2014would help determine whether the learned optical encoding captures universal spatial-frequency priors beneficial across imaging tasks or merely overfits to textures and statistics of the training set. Furthermore, analyzing whether the learned patterns generalize under distribution shifts (e.g., indoor vs. outdoor lighting, macro vs. wide-angle scenes) could inform their robustness and potential for real-world deployment.\n\n- From a reproducibility standpoint, the paper would be strengthened by disclosing key implementation details that critically affect training dynamics in co-designed systems. These include initialization strategies for the coded mask (e.g., random Gaussian, uniform, identity-like structures, or physics-inspired patterns such as Hadamard codes), learning rate schedules for both optical and digital parameters (including whether they are updated simultaneously or alternately), and whether batch normalization, dropout, or other architectural components were modified or removed to accommodate the differentiable optics layer. For example, standard normalization layers may interfere with the physical interpretability of intermediate features or destabilize gradient flow across modalities. Providing pseudocode or hyperparameter tables in the supplementary material would greatly assist future researchers attempting to build upon this work.\n\n- There is also room to discuss potential limitations in terms of robustness. Real-world imaging conditions involve variations in illumination intensity and spectrum, motion blur due to object or camera movement, defocus, and sensor noise (e.g., shot noise, read noise, dark current). How does SACoD perform under noisy measurements or non-ideal lighting compared to standard PhlatCam configurations? Simulating such perturbations during evaluation\u2014by injecting Poisson-Gaussian noise, applying random affine transformations, or varying exposure levels\u2014and analyzing their impact on reconstruction fidelity (via PSNR, SSIM, or task-driven accuracy) would enhance confidence in the method's applicability outside controlled laboratory environments. Additionally, investigating whether the learned mask inherently denoises or regularizes input signals\u2014or conversely, amplifies artifacts\u2014could reveal its implicit regularization properties.\n\n- The notion of treating the optical layer as a convolutional filter raises intriguing questions about its interpretability and alignment with classical optics principles. Visualizing the learned mask patterns\u2014both spatially and in the frequency domain\u2014and analyzing their spectral response could reveal whether they naturally converge toward known optimal coding strategies, such as Hadamard patterns, sinusoidal gratings, or random phase masks commonly used in compressive imaging. Alternatively, do they discover novel, data-driven structures that exploit correlations unique to the target application domain? Tools such as Fourier magnitude spectra, autocorrelation maps, or principal component analysis on the mask ensemble could bridge intuitive understanding between classical optics and modern learning-based paradigms, offering insights into what makes a \u201cgood\u201d learned aperture.\n\n- Furthermore, while model compression is highlighted as a key outcome, it remains unclear how much of the compression stems from reduced backend complexity versus intrinsic information encoding in the optical domain. A detailed breakdown of parameter savings specifically attributable to each component\u2014sensor (i.e., elimination of multiple lenses or filters) versus network (i.e., smaller decoder architecture)\u2014would clarify the source of efficiency gains and guide future efforts in hardware-algorithm co-design. For instance, if most savings come from shrinking the CNN, then similar results might be achievable without modifying optics; conversely, if the optical encoding enables drastic reductions in required resolution or bit depth, that would highlight its transformative role. Distinguishing these contributions strengthens the technical narrative and informs architectural decisions in follow-up works.\n\n- The work implicitly assumes monochromatic or narrowband imaging, likely simplifying the forward model and avoiding chromatic aberrations. Extending the framework to multispectral or full-color imaging introduces new degrees of freedom in mask design\u2014for example, wavelength-dependent transmittance, dispersion effects, or per-channel phase modulation\u2014which could either complicate optimization or unlock richer encoding capabilities. Although beyond the current scope, a brief discussion on scalability to multi-channel acquisition\u2014such as using learnable color filters, stacked diffractive layers, or spectrally multiplexed patterns\u2014could position SACoD as part of a broader class of adaptive sensors capable of dynamic spectral tuning. This would resonate strongly with applications in remote sensing, biomedical imaging, and augmented reality.\n\n- In terms of novelty, the idea of end-to-end optimization of physical sensors with neural networks has precedents in works such as differentiable cameras, programmable apertures, and meta-optics design using adjoint methods. To better delineate the contribution, the authors should emphasize what distinguishes SACoD\u2014particularly whether the formulation offers unique advantages in convergence speed, ease of fabrication, compatibility with existing architectures, or robustness to calibration errors\u2014compared to prior art in this space. Is the innovation primarily algorithmic (e.g., a new differentiable rendering module), architectural (e.g., seamless integration into standard CNNs), or empirical (e.g., superior performance on benchmark tasks)? Clarifying this distinction ensures appropriate credit is given to related efforts while highlighting the incremental advance.\n\n- Another consideration is the training data dependency of the entire pipeline. Since both the mask and the network are trained jointly on labeled data, the system may inherit biases present in the dataset\u2014such as texture dominance, category imbalance, or cultural skews\u2014leading to degraded performance on out-of-distribution samples. Exploring zero-shot or few-shot generalization, or incorporating domain randomization during training (e.g., simulating diverse weather conditions, occlusions, or sensor degradations), could mitigate overfitting to specific textures or object categories. Additionally, examining whether the learned mask performs poorly on adversarial or rare classes would assess its fairness and reliability in safety-critical settings.\n\n- From a software infrastructure perspective, the paper does not mention whether custom layers or simulators were developed to model light propagation through the coded aperture. Given the need for accurate diffraction modeling (e.g., Fresnel or angular spectrum methods), efficient backpropagation through wave optics, and GPU acceleration, it is likely that specialized tooling was involved. Open-sourcing such tools\u2014if available\u2014would greatly benefit the community by enabling further research in learnable optics without requiring extensive reimplementation. At minimum, describing the computational graph structure, numerical approximations used, and memory-footprint considerations would aid replication.\n\n- Additionally, the evaluation focuses primarily on classification accuracy post-reconstruction, which aggregates performance into a single scalar but overlooks nuances in perceptual quality or structural integrity of the recovered images. Expanding the assessment to include low-level vision metrics\u2014such as peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index (SSIM), LPIPS for perceptual distance, or NIQE for no-reference quality estimation\u2014would provide a more comprehensive view of image fidelity. This is particularly important in applications where human interpretation (e.g., medical diagnosis) or downstream processing (e.g., object tracking, OCR) depends on fine-grained details preserved in the reconstruction.\n\n- It would also be informative to compare the number of trainable parameters introduced by the optical layer relative to the overall model. If the mask contains millions of free variables\u2014comparable to or exceeding the size of lightweight CNNs\u2014it might offset some of the claimed efficiency benefits despite reductions in digital compute, especially considering that optical parameters cannot be pruned or quantized post-hoc without affecting physical realization. Clarifying this trade-off\u2014perhaps via a parameter ratio or memory-cost comparison\u2014would refine the narrative around compactness and prevent misinterpretation of the source of gains.\n\n- Lastly, the paper presents a promising step toward intelligent sensor design, but long-term viability depends on adaptability. Future extensions could explore dynamic masks updated in real-time based on scene content\u2014enabled by tunable liquid-crystal materials, MEMS arrays, or electro-optic polymers\u2014an avenue that, while technically challenging, would push the boundaries of responsive imaging systems. Even a short discussion on incremental pathways toward such capabilities\u2014such as offline mask ensembles selected via context-aware switching, or online fine-tuning under user feedback\u2014would enrich the paper\u2019s forward-looking perspective and inspire follow-up work in adaptive, lifelong sensing systems.","op1":"create","op2":"expand","domain":"openreview","model":"Qwen"}
{"human":"This paper argues that black-box, data-driven statistical machine learning approaches will, ultimately, be unable to display the kind of predictive reasoning that humans excel at, because they are fundamentally interpolators, and that causal reasoning is both necessary and well-suited to robotics. All of this is true. The authors also give a well-written and very accessible overview of the literature applying causal reasoning to robotics and sequential decision-making. The argument that the paper makes about black-box machine learning is just inarguably true, and the the paper is well written and persuasive. The paper also points out that causal reasoning makes the most sense in areas where an agent is able to intervene to change the world; that's where it is easiest to test, in some sense, and also where it is most useful for making predictions. \n\nOne slight quibble I have with the whole line pushing causal reasoning into robotics and RL, is that it's never been clear to me how a causal model fundamentally differs from a transition model in RL; and we have been studying dependencies in forward models in a similar way since the early 2000s (primarily under the heading of factored MDPs). These approaches have also always used Bayesian modeling that explicitly considers similar relationships, e.g. they are often modeled using DBNs that are not fully connected. And of course there have been papers that try to learn which edges should be present and which not (e.g., Strehl in 2007 and Vigorito a few years later). It'd be helpful to clear up if these two lines are in some sense fundamentally the same, or if there's something that I (and many RL people) am missing.\n\nI docked a point on clarity of presentation for the paper's use of numerical parenthetic citations as nouns, which spoiled an otherwise very pleasant reading experience.","LLM_1":"- The paper makes a compelling case for integrating causal models into robotic systems, particularly in domains requiring long-horizon planning and adaptation to novel environments. One area that could benefit from further elaboration is the practical challenges of learning or specifying causal structures in real-world robotic applications. While the authors acknowledge the difficulty of acquiring accurate causal knowledge, a deeper discussion on how partial or approximate causal models might still confer advantages over purely associative methods would strengthen the argument. For instance, recent work in causal discovery from observational and interventional data under unmeasured confounding could be referenced to illustrate pathways toward scalable causal model acquisition.\n\n- A notable strength of the survey is its clarity in distinguishing between different levels of causal reasoning\u2014ranging from simple intervention-based prediction (e.g., \"what happens if I push this object?\") to counterfactual reasoning (e.g., \"what would have happened if I had acted differently?\"). However, the transition from theoretical frameworks like Pearl\u2019s do-calculus or structural causal models to actual implementation in robotic control loops remains a significant engineering challenge. It would be valuable to include concrete examples or case studies where causal models have demonstrably improved performance over non-causal baselines in tasks such as manipulation, navigation, or human-robot interaction. Such empirical validation would help ground the theoretical claims and guide practitioners in applying these ideas.\n\n- The discussion on sequential decision-making touches on important themes, including the limitations of reinforcement learning in out-of-distribution scenarios. Yet, there is an opportunity to expand on how causal abstractions can reduce sample complexity in learning. For example, by enabling transfer across tasks through modular recombination of causal mechanisms, robots may avoid relearning entire policies from scratch when environments change. This ties into the concept of \"causal priors\" or inductive biases that constrain hypothesis spaces more effectively than generic neural architectures. Elaborating on how such priors can be encoded\u2014whether through symbolic interfaces, hybrid architectures, or meta-learning frameworks\u2014would add substantial value.\n\n- While the focus on robotics is well-justified, the paper could more explicitly address the role of perception in causal inference. In most real-world settings, robots do not receive clean, high-level variables but must extract them from raw sensory inputs such as images or point clouds. Bridging the gap between low-level perception and high-level causal modeling remains a key bottleneck. Recent approaches combining variational autoencoders with causal structure learning, or using object-centric representations as inputs to causal graphs, represent promising directions. Including a section on perceptual front-ends for causal reasoning would make the survey more comprehensive and forward-looking.\n\n- The treatment of uncertainty within causal models deserves greater attention. Traditional probabilistic reasoning in robotics often relies on Bayesian filtering or Gaussian processes, which quantify uncertainty in predictions but do not necessarily distinguish between epistemic and aleatoric sources, nor do they support interventionist queries. Causal models, in principle, offer a richer framework for uncertainty propagation under interventions. Exploring how causal Bayesian networks or probabilistic programs can be used to maintain and update beliefs under both observation and action would enhance the relevance of the paper to autonomous systems operating under partial observability.\n\n- Another dimension worth exploring is the interaction between causality and safety-critical decision-making. Robots deployed in healthcare, transportation, or domestic settings must justify their actions and anticipate rare but catastrophic outcomes. Counterfactual reasoning, in particular, offers a formal language for answering \u201cwhat-if\u201d questions about alternative courses of action\u2014an essential capability for explainability and accountability. The authors could strengthen their position by discussing ongoing efforts to verify and validate causal models in safety-sensitive contexts, perhaps drawing parallels with formal methods in control theory or regulatory standards in AI ethics.\n\n- From a methodological standpoint, the paper would benefit from a critical comparison of competing frameworks for causal representation. For instance, while structural causal models dominate much of the discourse, alternatives such as potential outcomes (Rubin Causal Model), causal graphical models with latent variables, or even category-theoretic approaches each come with trade-offs in expressivity, identifiability, and computational tractability. A brief taxonomy of available tools, along with guidance on selecting appropriate formalisms based on task requirements (e.g., interpretability vs. scalability), would aid readers in navigating the landscape.\n\n- The review also omits discussion of active causal discovery\u2014the idea that robots can design experiments or interventions to learn causal structure autonomously. This is particularly relevant in robotics, where agents have agency and can interact strategically with their environment. Work on information-gathering actions, experimental design in causal inference, and curiosity-driven exploration for mechanism identification could be integrated to highlight how robots might become not just users of causal knowledge, but active generators of it.\n\n- On a technical note, the integration of causal reasoning with deep learning components presents both opportunities and pitfalls. While end-to-end differentiable causal modules (e.g., neural SCMs) allow for gradient-based optimization, they risk obscuring the very interpretability that motivates causal modeling in the first place. The tension between flexibility and transparency warrants explicit discussion. Potential solutions\u2014such as enforcing modularity, sparsity, or semantic constraints in learned models\u2014could be surveyed to guide future research toward architectures that preserve causal interpretability without sacrificing performance.\n\n- The paper positions causal reasoning as a necessary step beyond current ML paradigms, yet it does not fully engage with hybrid approaches that combine data-driven learning with symbolic reasoning. Systems that integrate neural perception with symbolic planners, for example, already exhibit some characteristics of causal thinking, especially when rules encode physical or temporal dependencies. Drawing connections between these existing hybrid architectures and formal causal frameworks could help bridge communities and accelerate adoption in real-world robotic platforms.\n\n- Finally, the broader impact of adopting causal reasoning in robotics extends beyond technical performance. It has implications for human-robot collaboration, where shared mental models depend on mutual understanding of intentions and consequences. If robots can reason causally, they may better predict human behavior, explain their own decisions, and recover gracefully from misunderstandings. Expanding the conclusion to include societal and interactive dimensions would underscore the transformative potential of this research direction.\n\n- In summary, the paper provides a timely and accessible foundation for understanding the role of causality in robotics. To further elevate its contribution, the authors are encouraged to incorporate more concrete implementation challenges, empirical benchmarks, and interdisciplinary connections. Strengthening the link between theory and practice will ensure that the call for causal reasoning resonates not only with AI researchers but also with engineers building real-world autonomous systems.","LLM_2":"The tone has been refined to match standard peer-review conventions: constructive, precise, and professionally critical.\n\n---\n\n- The paper presents a compelling argument for incorporating causal reasoning into robotic systems, especially in settings involving long-horizon planning and adaptation to unfamiliar environments. However, the practical challenges associated with acquiring or defining causal structures in real-world applications warrant deeper exploration. While the authors acknowledge the difficulty of obtaining accurate causal knowledge, further discussion on how *approximate* or *partial* causal models could still outperform purely associative approaches would strengthen the narrative. For instance, citing recent advances in causal discovery under unmeasured confounding\u2014using both observational and interventional data\u2014could illustrate feasible pathways toward scalable model acquisition in complex domains.\n\n- A key strength of the survey lies in its clear articulation of different levels of causal inference, from intervention-based predictions (e.g., \u201cwhat happens if I act?\u201d) to counterfactual reasoning (e.g., \u201cwhat would have happened otherwise?\u201d). Nevertheless, translating theoretical frameworks such as Pearl\u2019s do-calculus or structural causal models into functional components within robotic control loops remains a substantial engineering hurdle. Including concrete case studies where causal models have led to measurable improvements over non-causal baselines\u2014in tasks like manipulation, navigation, or human-robot interaction\u2014would provide valuable empirical grounding. Such examples would not only validate theoretical claims but also guide practitioners in implementation.\n\n- The section on sequential decision-making effectively highlights limitations of reinforcement learning in out-of-distribution scenarios. Yet, there is an opportunity to elaborate on how causal abstractions can reduce sample complexity during learning.

This connects naturally to the idea of *causal priors*\u2014structured inductive biases that more efficiently constrain hypothesis spaces than generic neural architectures. Expanding on methods for encoding these priors\u2014via symbolic interfaces, hybrid neuro-symbolic systems, or meta-learning frameworks\u2014would significantly enhance the paper\u2019s utility.\n\n- Although the focus on robotics is well-motivated, the role of perception in enabling causal inference deserves greater emphasis. In most real-world deployments, robots operate on raw sensory inputs (e.g., images, point clouds), not pre-defined high-level variables. Extracting meaningful causal variables from such low-level signals remains a major bottleneck. Recent work combining variational autoencoders with causal structure learning, or leveraging object-centric representations as inputs to causal graphs, offers promising solutions. Adding a dedicated discussion on perceptual front-ends for causal reasoning would improve the survey\u2019s comprehensiveness and forward-looking perspective.\n\n- Uncertainty modeling within causal frameworks merits more detailed treatment. Traditional approaches in robotics\u2014such as Bayesian filtering or Gaussian processes\u2014quantify uncertainty but often fail to distinguish between epistemic and aleatoric sources, and they do not support interventionist queries. Causal models, by contrast, offer richer semantics for belief updating under both observation and action. Discussing how causal Bayesian networks or probabilistic programs can propagate uncertainty under interventions would increase the relevance of this work to autonomous systems operating under partial observability and safety constraints.\n\n- The intersection of causality and safety-critical decision-making represents another important avenue for expansion. In domains such as healthcare, transportation, or domestic assistance, robots must justify their actions and anticipate rare yet high-consequence events. Counterfactual reasoning provides a formal mechanism for evaluating alternative courses of action\u2014an essential feature for explainability and accountability. Strengthening this part of the discussion by referencing ongoing efforts in verification and validation of causal models\u2014perhaps drawing parallels with formal methods in control theory or regulatory frameworks in AI ethics\u2014would underscore their practical importance.\n\n- Methodologically, a comparative analysis of competing causal representation frameworks would add significant value. While structural causal models are prominently featured, other paradigms\u2014including the potential outcomes framework (Rubin Causal Model), latent-variable graphical models, and even category-theoretic formulations\u2014offer distinct trade-offs in expressivity, identifiability, and computational feasibility. A concise taxonomy of available tools, paired with guidance on selecting appropriate formalisms based on application needs (e.g., interpretability vs. scalability), would help readers navigate the landscape and make informed design choices.\n\n- The concept of *active causal discovery*\u2014where agents autonomously design interventions to learn causal structure\u2014is notably absent. Given that robots possess agency, they are uniquely positioned to perform targeted experiments (e.g., probing objects to infer physical properties). Integrating literature on information-driven actions, experimental design in causal inference, and curiosity-based exploration for mechanism identification would highlight how robots can transition from passive users to active generators of causal knowledge\u2014a powerful extension of the current scope.\n\n- Technically, the integration of causal reasoning with deep learning introduces both opportunities and risks. Differentiable causal modules (e.g., neural structural causal models) facilitate end-to-end training, but may compromise the interpretability that motivates their use in the first place. This tension between flexibility and transparency should be explicitly addressed. Surveying strategies to preserve interpretability\u2014such as enforcing modularity, sparsity, or semantic consistency in learned models\u2014could guide future research toward architectures that balance performance with explainability.\n\n- The paper advocates for causal reasoning as a necessary evolution beyond current machine learning paradigms, yet engages minimally with hybrid neuro-symbolic approaches that already exhibit causal-like behavior. Systems combining neural perception with symbolic planners, for instance, often encode temporal or physical dependencies in rule-based forms, approximating aspects of causal thinking. Drawing connections between these existing architectures and formal causal theories could foster cross-disciplinary dialogue and accelerate adoption in real-world robotic platforms.\n\n- Finally, the broader implications of causal reasoning extend beyond algorithmic performance to include societal and interactive dimensions. In human-robot collaboration, shared understanding hinges on mutual models of intention and consequence. Robots equipped with causal reasoning may better predict human behavior, justify their own decisions, and recover from miscoordination. Expanding the conclusion to reflect on these collaborative and ethical aspects would reinforce the transformative potential of this research direction.\n\n- In summary, the paper offers a timely and accessible entry point into the role of causality in robotics. To further elevate its impact, the authors are encouraged to incorporate more discussion of implementation barriers, empirical benchmarks, and interdisciplinary linkages. Bolstering the connection between theoretical foundations and practical deployment will ensure that the call for causal reasoning resonates not only with AI researchers but also with engineers developing real-world autonomous systems.\n\n--- \n\nThis revised version maintains all original points while improving flow, precision, and alignment with academic review standards\u2014emphasizing constructive critique, technical depth, and forward-looking recommendations.","op1":"create","op2":"rewrite","domain":"openreview","model":"Qwen"}

WE WERE TRYING TO ASK HIM HOW WE SHOULD HANDLE DEVELOPMENT OF HIS SYSTEM AND HE RESPONDED IN A VERY SHORT MANNER AND WITH ANSWERS THAT DIDN\u2019T QUITE MATCH THE QUESTIONS ASKED.  NORMALLY WE WOULD HAVE BRUSHED IT OFF BECAUSE OF THE STRONG RELATIONSHIP WE HAVE WITH HIM, BUT THIS RESPONSE HIT A NERVE ON OUR SIDE.  WE READ THE EMAIL AND STEWED NOT ONLY ON HIS MISUNDERSTANDING OF THE QUESTIONS ASKED, BUT THE SHORT TONE HE USED WHEN ANSWERING.  LET ME BE CLEAR, I LIKE THIS CLIENT AND THE LOYALTY WE MUTUALLY HAVE WITH EACH OTHER WASN\u2019T RESONATING WELL IN THE EMAIL.  SO, ON OUR SIDE WE BROKE DOWN THE EMAIL TO FIND WHAT WAS BUGGING US.  IT WASN\u2019T JUST THE SHORTNESS OR THE MISUNDEERSTANDING, BUT THAT HE WROTE ALL HIS RESPONSES IN ALL CAPS.  THIS SUBCONCIOUSLY LED US TO BELIEVE THAT HE WAS SCREAMING AT US.  ONCE I REALIZED THIS I CALLED THE CLIENT ON THE PHONE TO TALK THROUGH THE ISSUES AND FOUND OUT THAT HE WASN\u2019T ANGRY WITH US, JUST WAS IN A RUSH AND USED THE CAPS LOCK TO MAKE HIS COMMENTS MORE VISIBLE WITHIN THE EMAIL.  I LEARNED SOME VALUABLE LESSONS THROUGH THIS EMAIL.  THAT IN THIIS ELECTROINC AGE WE CAN MISREAD OR MISUNDERSTAND THE INTENT OF AN EMAIL.

JUST GET ON THE PHONE OR MEET THAT PERSON FACE TO FACE.  THAT WAY THERE IS NO MISUNDERSTANDING.  I ALMOST FORGOT, DON\u2019T USE ALL CAPS SINCE IT DOES INTONE SCREAMING AND LOOKS TERRIBLE TO READ.      ","LLM_1":"...we have with him, but this particular response stood out for its brevity and apparent lack of clarity. At first, we thought maybe he was just having a really bad day, like I mentioned earlier, or perhaps he had a lot on his plate and was feeling overwhelmed. But as we started to re-read his response, it dawned on us that maybe, just maybe - this was a symptom of something more.\n\nYou see, as a business, our goal is always to provide top-notch support to our clients, even when they're not having the best day. We pride ourselves on being responsive, empathetic, communication experts, who can distill complex ideas into actionable advice. And yet, in this instance, the opposite seemed to be happening. Our usually clear-headed client was sending mixed signals, leaving us to decipher his intentions, rather than providing the straightforward answers we were looking for.\n\nAs we pondered this anomaly, a few possible explanations began to emerge. Was he genuinely struggling to articulate his thoughts, despite our best efforts to guide him through the process? Or was something else at play? Perhaps, he'd simply taken a step back to reassess the project's overall direction, only to realize that our previous discussions hadn't quite aligned with his vision. Whatever the reason, one thing became clear - we needed to take a more nuanced approach to communication.\n\nIn the past, when faced with unclear responses, I've found that taking a moment to breathe, re-reading the conversation thread, often sheds new light on things. This time, however, that approach didn't seem to yield the expected results. It was as if we'd hit a brick wall, with our client's response leaving more questions than answers. In situations like this, where the stakes are high and time is of essence, clarity and precision become paramount.\n\nIt's worth noting that, during times of uncertainty or high-pressure situations, individuals may become more guarded or defensive in their responses. They might inadvertently convey mixed messages, either due to frustration, self-doubt, anxiety, stress, personal issues, lack or trust, fear of making mistakes, need to maintain control, miscommunication, change, uncertainty, new situations or pressure from external factors. When faced such situations our empathy and active listening become crucial to understand and address the underlying concerns.\n\nThe next step was clear: we had to adapt our communication strategy, shifting from a straightforward Q&A approach, to one that prioritized empathy, understanding, active probing and, of course, clear language. By acknowledging the elephant in the room, so to speak, - that this response was an anomaly - and openly addressing it, without taking it personally, might just help to break the ice and get us back on track. After all, building trust and fostering a collaborative environment requires a delicate balance between assertiveness and understanding. So, let's take this opportunity to explore the intricacies of communication in high-stakes situations and how it affects the success of our projects. How we navigate these complexities will ultimately determine whether our relationships with clients like our friend, remain strong and fruitful, for years to come. \n\nIn future, how we communicate will be a key aspect to address to improve the outcomes of projects and to build long term relationships. As we know the business is built on trust. Effective communication will allow us not only navigate high stakes situation but also it will also help us build a stronger foundation with the clients. A solid foundation that is not just based in trust but it is also based upon mutual understanding and respect. That's why effective communication is essential in business. The way we approach and navigate a high pressure situation can define the outcome of a project. Communication is key. If we don't get it right, then it can lead to misinterpretation and confusion. Therefore, effective and clear communication can help avoid miscommunications and misunderstandings. Thus, this is an important aspect that we must pay attention to in our business to ensure that the relationship with client remains strong.  It will help build trust that will last in long-term. I hope that by sharing this experience, you can better understand the importance of effective, open, honest, transparent and empathic communication. These are key to building a strong business relationship. To navigate the complexity of business relationships, being aware of how others perceive the situation is crucial. With awareness and effective approach we can build strong relationship that last. Just like in any other situation, having clear goals, knowing the right communication approach will make the difference. Having the goal to communicate effectively in mind will lead us on right path. Understanding the client is the key, what they want, their needs and the way they perceive things are the keys to success. There are no one-size-fits-all approaches to business communication, each situation requires its own approach. Building a relationship requires taking the time to listen to the other person, understand their point of view, ask the questions and clarify the things that are unclear. Establishing trust is about building that relationship by being transparent, approachable and reliable. Clarity in communication helps in avoiding confusion and ensures that everyone is on same page. Good communication means getting to know each other, sharing information and being open to feedback. Trust and strong relationships are built when we listen, communicate clearly and effectively. Knowing when to ask for help is important, seeking the advice of an expert is a sign of strength, not weakness. Seeking help, listening and communicating effectively are all key elements of building strong, lasting relationships in your business or in personal relationships.\n\nCommunication is at the heart of all business and personal interactions. Clear, concise and respectful communication builds trust with colleagues, clients and other stakeholders. Without effective two-way communication the misunderstands will occur and that can damage the relationships and lead the failure of project or business as whole. Open and honest communication makes sure that all parties are informed and on board with project goals and objectives. Transparency builds credibility. Strong relationships that result in success are based around open and transparent communication and building on mutual trust.\n\nTo achieve that you need be aware that communication involves not merely conveying information, thoughts and ideas, also involves receiving them. Being open-minded, willing to learn and adapt, are critical components of successful business communications. Don't be afraid to say 'I don\u2019t know', or 'let me check on that'. It\u2019s okay to not have all the answers and taking time out to research the information is sign that your interested in getting it correct. Be transparent about what you do and don\u2018t know, build the trust by acknowledging your limitations,  communicate with empathy. People are more likely to respond positively if they feel heard and understood. Taking time and effort to really listen and understand others' perspectives can make a huge difference in building and maintaining strong working relationships","LLM_2":"**The Power of Effective Communication in Business**\n\nAs business professionals, providing top-tier support is our top priority, especially when our valued clients are having an off day or feeling the pressure. Recently, an interaction with one of them stood apart for both its conciseness and lackluster clarity.\n\nAt first glance, there was the possibility that they were simply having one bad morning or that a multitude of tasks were overwhelming them, causing frustration. However, upon re-examining the response and engaging in introspection, another, more profound explanation became apparent: this could be an indication of deeper issues at hand.\n\n**Communication Breakdown: An Opportunity for Growth**\n\nOur organization prides itself on its exceptional responsiveness, empathy-driven communication expertise, which skillfully distills complex concepts into practical advice that resonates with its clients' needs. Yet, here, something unexpected occurred. Instead of clear-cut answers, mixed signs and uncertainty dominated the exchange, prompting us, on our end, into a puzzle of deciphering their intentions.\n\nThis experience sparked an epiphany: communication calls for a nuanced, multi-faceted approach that goes beyond the conventional Q & A. One crucial aspect of this approach is acknowledging that uncertainty and pressure can cause individuals to become guarded, leading to confusing messages due various reasons.\n\nWhen faced by such scenarios, adopting an empathetical and actively listening approach becomes paramount to addressing the root concerns and laying the foundation for open communication channels.\n\nUpon reflection, adapting our approach was indispensable. Shifting from the standard Q and A to a model prioritizing empathy understanding active questioning and concise communication became crucial.\n\nBy recognizing this deviation and addressing its root cause, openly and without misinterpreting the intentions as personal attacks, could potentially break down barriers and revive the momentum of collaboration.\n\nMoreover, embracing this as an opportunity for growth and exploration, particularly in navigating complexities and determining the ultimate success in projects, led us down the path of exploring how effective high-level communication could help foster enduring and successful relationships between clients.\n\nBuilding trust in a long-lasting foundation is what our organization stands for. Mutual understanding based on respect is one pillar of that foundation. Hence, fostering effective open honest empathatic communication should always be our aim in order to avoid any miscommuncation or confusion.\n\nUnderstanding that effective  communication goes both ways, receiving information as well as conveying it. Staying open minded and willing learn are both key components that make up successful communication strategies. Saying \"I dont know\" is fine, taking your time for research and transparency about our limitations will only build more trust.\n\n\n\nBy sharing our experiences and lessons learned, hope to instill in readers the understanding of why open empathical transparent honest and well-communicated relationship is so important in both personal and business contexts. What's key is building relationships is taking awareness of others perceptions, awareness is power. Approach every situation with clear objectives, right approach with knowledge of what is best communication methods.

Conversely, MEKi and LY294002-induced TRL\/ 12 upregulation in statine d cells was associated w ith enhanced cytok ine secretion, suggesting a crucial role for the PI 3 K\/A kt pathway in regulating T LL 42 expression. These findings indicate that T RR  41\/42 signaling plays a key role in mediating the inhibitory effects observed in our previous studies, thereby providing new insights into t he anti-inflammator y effects associated wit h stat in treatment. Further studies are warranted to elucidate the molecular mechanisms governing TLL\/4 function in this context, with a view to developing novel therapeutic strategies targeting T T4 signaling pathways. \n\n(","LLM_2":"To elucidATE the role Tlr4 plays in antiinflammation, particularly in response to Lps and under statintreatment, we isolated CDllb + cells and exposed them to lbp.

{"human":"Eric thought he knew what it meant to be cold. It had been almost six centuries since the most recent ice age had started, and for most of his life everything north of the Grand River was covered in Ice. The river itself spent a majority of the year under a sheet of ice, and having grown up in border town of North Pass, widely known to the rest of the North American Federation as `` The Last Outpost of Civilization to the North'', Eric assumed he was well prepared for any cold weather that may have come his way. This was the assumption that he had made when he had volunteered to join the NAF Army's northern expedition. He still was n't 100 % sure what they were looking for, but it did n't matter. Whatever it was, all Eric cared about was that it paid well and there would n't be anything out in the frozen northern wasteland that he could n't handle. \n \n *After all, * Eric thought, *I knew what it meant to be cold. * \n \n This thought echoed in his head as Eric began to realize just how cold he felt. It was a painful kind of cold, different than anything he'd grown up with. He'd experienced 10 foot snowfalls, falling into the frozen river in the midst of winter, and even getting buried under an avalanche while skiing, as a child, and none of that was even half as painful a kind of cold as he felt now. The cold that enveloped him was a dark, dreary cold, that seeped into his bones and sapped his energy, encouraging him to sleep, as if burying his head in the depths of unconsciousness would hide him from the dangers of the cold all around him. \n \n *Shit, * Eric thought, *I ca n't fall asleep now, got ta stay up* \n \n It was dangerous to stop in the frigid north, since starting up again was that much harder, and people would run the danger of their limbs freezing in place if they did n't keep moving. He had to keep on... \n \n *Wait, what the fuck was I doing again? * \n \n Eric suddenly realized that he could n't see anything. Everything was just a cold darkness, hugging him to the point where he could n't see himself. The only way he could tell he still existed was from the painful cold tugging at his body. \n \n *Shit, I must've passed out already, * Eric thought, *Goddammit, I got ta get up. I ca n't be dead yet, being dead would n't hurt this bad. * \n \n Eric attempted to move and only felt pain as he struggled to get his limbs to start responding. As he forced himself to peel his eyes open, his vision of his own body came back to him. Albeit, bright and washed out, he could start to see the warmth come back to him. Squinting his eyes as they adjusted to the light flooding into his pupils, he looked down and saw his own naked and pale body, darkened only by the occasional bruises and whitened by the coldness that surrounded him, penetrating through the thick sleeping bag that covered his body, head to toe. \n \n *I recognize this bag, * Eric realized, *This is the emergency frostbite bag. * \n \n As Eric pulled his head up and his eyes open, he began to realize that wrapped around him, even tighter and heavier than the sleeping bag was another figure. Another body, naked and pale as his, but with considerably less hair and a different set of anatomical features, provided the only warmth he'd felt in what seemed like ages. As he pulled his vision all the way up, his gaze was returned with the pale face of a sleeping woman, one with long, dark, brown hair, falling past her shoulders, slightly pink lips that seemed to have had their color faded, and a stern, square jaw that he instantly recognized. \n \n This woman had been introduced to him as Melissa Lockhart, the NAF Sniper that had been assigned to their expedition. He had originally thought of her as a cold hearted bitch that only ever chided him every time he had trouble keeping up with the rest of the expedition, but here, in the sleeping bag, he could n't help but stare endlessly into the abyss of the large, cold depth of her dark blue eyes and mile-long dark brown lashes that surrounded them, framed perfectly by the clean, dark brown eyebrows that... \n \n *Eyes? * Eric thought for a moment, realizing that they had opened while he had been admiring her features. \n \n `` You have got to be the stupidest son of a bitch I have ever met,'' she said aloud, staring at him with the stern look on her face that seemed to be permanently printed on. \n \n `` Ah... what?'' Eric said, still trying to understand the situation. \n \n `` I told you not to climb that goddamn berm you idiot. Thanks to your inability to understand orders both of us are now stuck about nine hundred feet below the rest of the expedition.'' \n \n `` Oh... shit. What, uh, happened to us?'' Eric asked, still having a hard time recollecting the events leading up to the situation. \n \n Melissa sighed as she began climbing out of the bag. \n \n `` The snow bank ahead of us was a drift that had gathered over the ruins of an old city that had been built centuries before the ice age had started,'' she explained, reaching out of the bag for her cold weather gear that was stored in the drying bag she had left outside the sleeping bag. \n \n `` This particular snow drift was built up on a tall glass building, and it's entire structure was dependent on the strength of the glass. We were setting up camp just next to it when the storm came in and we lost our radio signal with the Appalachian Camp, and you tried to get a better signal by climbing onto the top of the berm. Which was actually a building,'' she deadpanned, pulling her base layers over head head. \n \n `` Oh. Wait so you mean the glass caved in when I walked on it?'' Eric asked, poking his head out of the sleeping bag. \n \n `` Yeah, we would've just left you but you took the long range radio with you and your life support monitor was still going so I came down to pull you out,'' Melissa said, sighing as she pinched the bridge of her nose for a bit, as if massaging a migraine out of her face. `` By the time I found you under all the snow though, you were unconscious and had a pretty bad case of hypothermia, so there was no way I was getting you out alone. And the storm had kicked in full force and basically covered the hole with another snow drift, so I couid n't signal to them to get in here and help me get you out.'' \n \n `` Well that explains the survival bag,'' Eric said, reaching out for another dry bag that looked like it had his clothes in it. \n \n `` Well there's no way in hell I'm getting you and your equipment out on my own, nor am I leaving your equipment, so I had to get you back up to shape to get out on your own,'' Melissa said, throwing her large military coat on over the previous layers she had already dressed herself with. \n \n Eric nodded as he began donning his own cold weather gear in silence. As he threw his parka on, he looked around the small room that they were in for anything to sit on while he put his boots back on when he realized how surprisingly dry the floor was. \n \n `` Where the hell are we?'' Eric asked, surprised at his surroundings. \n \n `` Seems like some kind of administrative facility,'' Melissa responded, shouldering her rifle. `` I saw some signs out in the hall that said'hey consulting' or something like that, whatever that means. This was the only room on the floor that was well insulated enough to use our dry bags and survival bags so I had to drag your ass in here.'' \n \n `` OK, cool. How do we get out?'' Eric posited, picking up the last of his equipment and throwing it over his shoulder. \n \n `` Not sure. There was a sign outside that said'EXIT TO TIME SQUARE' so I'm guessing we should check there first,'' Melissa said, walking towards the door. \n \n `` Anything dangerous out there?'' Erik wondered as he saw her open the door and walk out into the hallway. \n \n `` Please,'' Melissa said, turning around as soon as she was in the hallway,'' We're 900 feet under a snow bank in city ruins that have been abandoned for centuries. What could-'' \n \n The door between them slammed shut before Eric could hear her finish her response, and all he heard on the other side of the door after that were the screams of the only other person that had known he was even alive, slowly dying out into a light gurgle.\n","LLM_1":"was still moving was the faint, rhythmic crunch of his own boots breaking through a crust of snow he could no longer perceive.

It pulsed once, twice, and on the third beat, the darkness before him changed.\n\nA faint, sickly green light began to emanate from the ice beneath, illuminating the swirling particles of snow still hanging motionless in the air. The light revealed the nightmare landscape he stood in: a plain of jagged, blue-black ice stretching into infinity, under a sky of utter, starless black. No moon, no aurora, nothing. And there, perhaps a hundred yards ahead, the ice was wrong. It dipped into a vast, perfectly circular depression, from the center of which the green glow pulsed stronger, like a slow, malevolent heartbeat.\n\nEric\u2019s training warred with a primal, screaming instinct to flee.

Dark, elongated silhouettes moved with a liquid, unhurried grace just beneath the ice\u2019s surface, circling the central glow.

The thrumming deepened, and with it came a pressure against his mind, a whispering static that promised warmth if he would just come closer, just rest, just sleep\u2026\n\nHe took an involuntary step forward. The ice crunched, a deafening report in the silence.\n\nThe shapes froze. The thrumming ceased.\n\nIn the sudden, absolute quiet, a new sound started: a sharp, crystalline cracking, spider-webbing out from the depression directly toward him. The green light intensified, flooding the plain and casting long, dancing shadows from the ice ridges. Eric stumbled back, his body screaming in protest, but it was too late. The ice directly in front of him bulged upward and shattered.\n\nA figure emerged.\n\nIt was not one of the giant shapes. It was roughly man-sized, but its form was sculpted from what looked like clear, blue-veined ice and darker, obsidian-like stone. It had a head, shoulders, a torso, but its features were smooth, flowing planes, and where eyes should have been were two pools of that same virulent green light.

{"human":"       My car was broken into shortly before Christmas.  Some jackass broke a small side window thinking that with my car (which needed transmission work, fixed air conditioning, a new taillight, and two new door handles) was a veritable treasure trove of goodies. Primarily they wanted my new cd player, but since they couldn't pry it out of the dashboard and realized there was mostly a lot of shit in my car, they opted to take my hidden cd visor.    Now I thought that I cataloged every CD that was stolen so that I could moan appropriately when anyone mentioned the artist. Kind of Blue, Giant Steps, Jason Mraz, The Beatles, The Love Below, Ben Folds Five, Cake-- the list could go on and on.  About 30 CDs were taken among them was one CD of the Sinatra Reprise collection.  Just one. So I thought.  I understand what I am about to write is going to make me one of maybe twelve people under the age of thirty.  It's also going to make me sound like an ultra-geek, but I do not care.  I love Frank Sinatra.  That's right, love.  And I'm not talking about the movies (well, those too); I'm talking about the music.  To this day Frank Sinatra is one of only a handful of artists that I liked when I was thirteen that I still like today. The Christmas I was sixteen, I received one of the top ten best gifts ever (right up there with the My Little Pony Paradise Estates).  Great gifts are always something you really want, but never have to ask for. Those things that are unexpected.  And the Frank Sinatra Reprise Collection was one of them.  At the time, I only owned one Frank CD (it was hard then to save up enough cash to get anything and CDs were like two weeks of allowance).  My father picked up on how often he heard me listening to it and gave me four more.  I cannot convey how much I loved them.    Yesterday, I began to burn my CDs into iTunes (which has been long overdue) and realized more than just one of the cds were gone.  All of the cds were gone.  I was crushed.  No more 'My Shadow and Me'.  No more 'I'll Only Miss Her When I Think Of Her.'  No More 'What'll I Do.'  That is unless I want to shell about another $100 for a new set. I felt so violated when my car was broken into and rifled through, but it's nothing compared to the crappy feeling when I realized that some of my prize possessions had been taken.   What really kills me is the thought of them (probably) in a dumpster somewhere. I can't imagine a thief appreciating any good music, especially good music from over fifty years ago.          ","LLM_1":"...Album, *Rumours*, *The Chronic*, *Illmatic*, and a few mix CDs I\u2019d burned in college that had long since lost their labels\u2014those were the ones I actually cared about. Not because they were rare or valuable, but because each one carried a memory: a road trip, a breakup, a summer job where I played the same disc on repeat until the chorus felt like muscle memory. Losing them wasn\u2019t just about the music\u2014it was like someone had gone through my diary with greasy fingers and ripped out the pages they didn\u2019t understand.\n\nI spent a week after the break-in replaying those albums in my head, trying to reconstruct playlists, wondering if I\u2019d ever feel the same rush hearing \u201cSo What\u201d crackle through cheap speakers at 2 a.m. while driving nowhere. I even considered replacing them all digitally, but something about streaming felt like attending a memorial service via Zoom\u2014technically present, emotionally absent. There\u2019s no weight to a playlist. No liner notes smudged with fingerprints, no awkward silence between tracks when the CD skips because you left it in the dashboard cup holder during a heatwave.\n\nThen, out of nowhere, my neighbor Margo knocked on my door holding a Ziploc bag full of CDs. She\u2019d found them behind a dumpster two blocks over, scattered like discarded tarot cards. Most were scratched beyond redemption, but a few\u2014*Kind of Blue*, *Giant Steps*, the Beatles\u2019 white album\u2014were salvageable. She\u2019d recognized my name scrawled on the case of *The Love Album* (a gift from my ex who once swore we\u2019d get married if we ever made it through *Abbey Road* in one sitting). Margo didn\u2019t say much, just handed me the bag and said, \u201cFigured you might want these back, even if they\u2019re ghosts now.\u201d\n\nI sat on my porch that night with a bottle of cheap red and my portable CD player\u2014the kind with the retractable sun shield\u2014and played each one like a ritual. Some skipped. Some hissed like old radios tuned between stations. But hearing Coltrane wail through fractured speakers felt like a small victory. It reminded me that not everything broken is lost.

{"human":"This paper proposes a novel continual learning method that stores intersection of adversarial subspaces into long-term memory units for each task, which is used used to characterize the given task at future tasks. This adversarial memory network requires supposedly less number of parameters for each task to store, compared to methods that stores explicit examples. The authors validated the proposed model on three datasets for continual learning, on which it obtains good performance when networks trained with plain gradient descent and elastic weight consolidation suffers from catastrophic forgetting.\n\nPros\n- The idea of using adversarial subspaces to characterize a task is a novel idea which seems to work to some degree.\n\nCons\n\nExperimental validation is lacking in many aspects. \n\n- First, while the proposed method requires additional memory storage and parameters, it is not comparing against any of the existing work that increases network capacity or storing a small subset of the original dataset. To list a few that seems relevant, [Yoon et al. 18] proposes a network that can dynamically expand its capacity with minimal number of units per layer, and [Nguyen et al. 18] proposes to store a small subset called CoreSet that well-represent the task-specific dataset. To show that the proposed method is indeed effective in terms of accuracy over number of parameters, the authors should compare against such baselines with additional parameters. The increase in the network capacity reported in the paper seems quite large (over 60% for AD+EWC) and thus its effectiveness is questionable without such comparative study. \n\n- Their implementation of EWC seems suboptimal as it is only applied to fully connected layers, and thus the EWC baseline performs much poorly than what are reported in many of the previous work, and performs comparable to PGD. Since EWC baseline is crippled the only message that is remaining is that the proposed method works better than simple PGD. \n\n- The reported results using the proposed method shows some performance degradation on earlier tasks, which seems large considering the difficulty of the tasks. Again, the authors should compare against recent methods on continual learning so that the readers can understand how good these reported performances are.\n\n- It is difficult to understand why storing adversarial subspaces helps, since there is no visualization or illustrations that provide intuitive explanations. \n\nIn sum, while the proposed model seems novel, its motivation is unclear and it is difficult to assess the effectiveness of the proposed method due to lack of experimental validation. Thus I recommend the rating of reject for this paper, until the authors provide additional experimental results for proper assessment of the method's effectiveness.","LLM_1":"- The proposed use of adversarial subspaces offers a compelling alternative to experience replay and parameter isolation methods, particularly in reducing storage overhead. By encoding task-specific constraints through learned perturbations rather than storing raw data, the method aligns well with privacy-preserving continual learning objectives. This abstraction layer could open new directions for research into compact task representations.\n\n- The experimental design covers a range of standard benchmarks\u2014Split MNIST, Split CIFAR-10, and a multi-task variant of Permuted MNIST\u2014which allows for meaningful comparison against established baselines. Performance gains over EWC and vanilla SGD are clearly demonstrated, especially in later tasks where forgetting typically escalates. These results suggest that the memory units effectively retain critical decision boundaries without requiring access to prior data.\n\n- One notable strength lies in the model\u2019s ability to function without task identifiers during inference, a feature not always supported by regularization-based approaches. This trait enhances its applicability in real-world scenarios where task boundaries may be ambiguous or unavailable at test time.\n\n- However, the assumption that adversarial subspaces remain stable across task sequences warrants further scrutiny. While the current formulation treats each task\u2019s subspace as fixed once stored, dynamic shifts due to subsequent learning might degrade earlier representations. A mechanism for periodic refinement or adaptive updating of memory units could improve long-term stability.\n\n- The paper would benefit from a more detailed ablation study on the dimensionality of the adversarial subspaces. Specifically, how the size of the memory vectors impacts performance and generalization across tasks remains underexplored. Understanding this trade-off is crucial for assessing scalability, especially when transitioning to larger-scale vision or language domains.\n\n- Computational cost during training is another aspect needing clarification. Although memory efficiency is emphasized, generating adversarial subspaces likely introduces additional forward-backward passes per task. A breakdown of training time and GPU-hour comparisons relative to replay-based methods would strengthen claims about practicality.\n\n- The theoretical justification linking adversarial directions to task-discriminative features is intuitive but lacks formal grounding. While empirical validation supports the approach, a deeper analysis\u2014such as connections to influence functions or gradient alignment metrics\u2014could bolster confidence in the method\u2019s design principles.\n\n- An important limitation arises in non-stationary environments where concept drift occurs within tasks. Since the current framework assumes discrete, stationary tasks, its behavior under gradual distributional shifts remains untested. Extending the model to detect and adapt to such changes could significantly broaden its scope.\n\n- The authors do not address potential interference between stored subspaces as task sequence length increases. Overlapping adversarial directions across tasks might lead to conflicting constraints during optimization. Investigating orthogonality penalties or clustering mechanisms in memory space could mitigate such interference.\n\n- Interpretability of the learned subspaces is currently limited. Visualizing or analyzing what types of input transformations these subspaces encode\u2014e.g., edge detection, color shifts, texture patterns\u2014would provide valuable insight into their semantic meaning and robustness.\n\n- Comparison to recent state-of-the-art methods beyond EWC and SGD is relatively sparse. Including results against methods like DER (Dark Experience Replay), GDumb, or LwF (Learning without Forgetting) would better position the proposed approach within the modern continual learning landscape.\n\n- The paper does not discuss sensitivity to hyperparameters such as the number of adversarial steps, perturbation magnitude, or memory vector dimension. Given that adversarial training is notoriously sensitive to such choices, a robustness analysis would enhance reproducibility and trust in the reported results.\n\n- While the focus on parameter efficiency is commendable, it may come at the expense of expressiveness. There is an inherent risk that compressed representations fail to capture nuanced aspects of complex tasks, particularly in high-dimensional outputs like those in fine-grained classification or generative settings.\n\n- The current evaluation protocol uses accuracy as the sole metric. Incorporating measures such as backward transfer, forward transfer, and training stability would offer a more comprehensive view of lifelong learning dynamics and help disentangle improvements due to reduced forgetting versus enhanced learning speed.\n\n- It would also be informative to evaluate the method in class-incremental settings, where new categories are introduced continuously without explicit task labels. Such setups pose greater challenges due to inter-task confusion and are increasingly considered standard in benchmarking continual learning algorithms.\n\n- The writing, while generally clear, occasionally suffers from imprecise terminology\u2014for instance, referring to \"adversarial subspaces\" without specifying whether they are linear or nonlinear manifolds. Clarifying mathematical definitions and ensuring consistent usage throughout would improve technical rigor.\n\n- Figures and diagrams are minimal, limiting intuitive understanding of the architecture and memory interaction process. Adding a schematic illustrating how adversarial perturbations are generated, stored, and applied during future training would greatly aid readability.\n\n- Lastly, the reproducibility of the work would be strengthened by releasing code and precomputed memory units. Given the complexity of adversarial training pipelines, open-sourcing implementation details ensures fair comparison and facilitates community adoption.\n\nIn summary, the paper presents a conceptually innovative and technically sound contribution to continual learning, leveraging adversarial subspaces as compact task descriptors. Its strengths in memory efficiency and avoidance of data replay make it a promising direction for scalable lifelong learning systems. Addressing the above points\u2014particularly regarding scalability, robustness, and broader empirical validation\u2014would further solidify its impact and applicability in both theoretical and applied contexts.","LLM_2":"The content has been restructured slightly for coherence and enhanced with appropriate academic phrasing while preserving all original points.\n\n---\n\n**Reviewer Comments**\n\nThe paper presents a conceptually novel approach to continual learning through the use of adversarial subspaces as compact task representations. By encoding task-specific knowledge via learned adversarial perturbations rather than relying on data replay or explicit parameter isolation, the method offers a promising alternative that aligns well with privacy-conscious and memory-efficient deployment scenarios. The core idea leverages adversarial directions in input space to define constraints that preserve performance on prior tasks, thereby mitigating catastrophic forgetting without storing raw samples.\n\nOne of the primary strengths of this work lies in its emphasis on storage efficiency\u2014an increasingly critical consideration in real-world lifelong learning systems. The proposed framework demonstrates strong empirical performance across standard benchmarks, including Split MNIST, Split CIFAR-10, and a multi-task variant of Permuted MNIST. Notably, it outperforms established baselines such as Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) and vanilla Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), particularly in later tasks where forgetting typically intensifies. These results suggest that the learned memory units effectively encode and retain essential decision boundaries, enabling sustained generalization without access to historical data.\n\nA further advantage is the model\u2019s ability to operate without requiring task identifiers at inference time\u2014a notable improvement over many regularization-based methods that depend on explicit task labels during evaluation. This feature enhances practical applicability in settings where task boundaries are ambiguous or unavailable, thus bringing the method closer to realistic deployment conditions.\n\nDespite these merits, several aspects warrant deeper investigation and clarification:\n\n1. **Stability of Adversarial Subspaces**:  \n   The current formulation assumes that once learned, adversarial subspaces remain fixed and stable throughout subsequent task learning. However, this assumption may not hold under prolonged sequential training, where updates for new tasks could inadvertently distort earlier subspaces. A mechanism for periodic refinement or adaptive updating of stored memory units\u2014such as gradient projection or subspace alignment\u2014could improve long-term representational fidelity and robustness against interference.\n\n2. **Ablation on Subspace Dimensionality**:  \n   The impact of memory vector dimensionality on model performance and generalization remains underexplored. A systematic ablation study analyzing how varying the size of adversarial subspaces affects retention, scalability, and cross-task transfer would provide valuable insights into design trade-offs. Such an analysis is particularly crucial when considering extensions to high-dimensional domains like large-scale vision or natural language processing tasks.\n\n3. **Computational Overhead**:  \n   While the method emphasizes memory efficiency, the computational cost associated with generating adversarial subspaces per task requires greater transparency. Given that adversarial training typically involves multiple forward-backward passes, a detailed comparison of training time, iteration complexity, and GPU-hour consumption relative to replay-based approaches (e.g., experience replay or reservoir sampling) would strengthen claims regarding practical feasibility.\n\n4. **Theoretical Underpinnings**:  \n   Although the intuition behind using adversarial directions as task-discriminative features is compelling, the theoretical justification remains limited. A more rigorous analysis\u2014potentially drawing connections to influence functions, gradient alignment, or Fisher information geometry\u2014would enhance confidence in the method's foundational principles and clarify why certain perturbation directions serve as effective task signatures.\n\n5. **Performance Under Concept Drift**:  \n   The current framework assumes discrete, stationary tasks, which limits its applicability in non-stationary environments characterized by gradual concept drift. Evaluating the model\u2019s behavior under continuous distributional shifts\u2014and potentially extending it with mechanisms for online adaptation or drift detection\u2014would significantly broaden its scope and relevance to dynamic real-world applications.\n\n6. **Interference Between Stored Subspaces**:  \n   As the number of sequentially learned tasks increases, there is a risk of interference due to overlapping or conflicting adversarial directions. Without mechanisms to enforce orthogonality or cluster subspaces in memory space, optimization conflicts may arise. Investigating regularizers that promote independence among stored representations\u2014or modular architectures that isolate task-specific components\u2014could mitigate such issues.\n\n7. **Interpretability of Learned Representations**:  \n   Currently, the semantic meaning of the encoded adversarial subspaces lacks interpretability. Visualization techniques or probing analyses to identify what types of input transformations these subspaces capture\u2014such as edge modifications, color shifts, texture variations, or semantic attributes\u2014would offer deeper insight into their functional role and robustness properties.\n\n8. **Comparison to State-of-the-Art Methods**:  \n   The experimental comparison is somewhat narrow, focusing primarily on EWC and SGD. Including evaluations against more recent state-of-the-art continual learning strategies\u2014such as Dark Experience Replay (DER), GDumb, Learning without Forgetting (LwF), or iCaRL\u2014would better situate the proposed method within the contemporary research landscape and clarify its relative advantages and limitations.\n\n9. **Hyperparameter Sensitivity**:  \n   Adversarial training is known to be highly sensitive to hyperparameters such as the number of perturbation steps, step size, and perturbation magnitude. A comprehensive sensitivity analysis examining the robustness of performance across different configurations\u2014particularly with respect to memory vector initialization and update rules\u2014would improve reproducibility and guide future implementations.\n\n10. **Expressiveness vs. Compression Trade-off**:  \n    While parameter efficiency is commendable, there exists an inherent tension between compression and representational capacity. In complex tasks involving fine-grained classification or generative modeling, overly compressed adversarial subspaces may fail to capture nuanced task structure. Clarifying the limits of expressiveness in such contexts would help delineate the method\u2019s domain of applicability.\n\n11. **Evaluation Metrics**:  \n    The reliance on final accuracy alone provides an incomplete picture of continual learning dynamics. Incorporating additional metrics\u2014such as backward transfer (BWT), forward transfer (FWT), training stability, and forgetting curves\u2014would enable a more granular assessment of both knowledge preservation and acquisition capabilities, disentangling improvements due to reduced forgetting from those arising from faster learning.\n\n12. **Class-Incremental Settings**:  \n    The absence of evaluation in class-incremental scenarios\u2014where new classes are introduced incrementally without explicit task boundaries\u2014represents a significant gap. Such setups pose greater challenges due to inter-task confusion and are now widely adopted as standard benchmarks. Testing the method in this regime would demonstrate its resilience in label-space ambiguity and further validate its generalization potential.\n\n13. **Clarity and Terminology**:  \n    While the writing is generally clear, some technical terms are used imprecisely. For instance, the term \u201cadversarial subspaces\u201d is employed without specifying whether they constitute linear subspaces, nonlinear manifolds, or latent constraint sets. Providing formal definitions and ensuring consistent usage throughout the manuscript would enhance mathematical rigor and conceptual clarity.\n\n14. **Visual Presentation**:  \n    The lack of illustrative figures impedes intuitive understanding of the architecture and memory interaction process. A schematic diagram depicting the generation, storage, and application of adversarial perturbations during training would greatly aid comprehension, especially for readers less familiar with adversarial learning paradigms.\n\n15. **Reproducibility**:  \n    To facilitate verification and community adoption, the release of code and precomputed memory units is strongly encouraged. Given the complexity of adversarial training pipelines and the sensitivity to implementation details, open-sourcing the full experimental setup will ensure fair comparisons and foster follow-up research.\n\n---\n\n**Summary and Recommendation**\n\nIn summary, the paper introduces an innovative and technically sound contribution to the field of continual learning. The use of adversarial subspaces as compact, reusable task descriptors represents a creative departure from conventional paradigms, offering notable advantages in terms of memory efficiency and privacy preservation. The empirical results are encouraging, and the conceptual framework opens new avenues for research into efficient lifelong learning systems.\n\nHowever, to fully establish the method\u2019s significance and robustness, the authors are encouraged to address the aforementioned concerns\u2014particularly with respect to scalability, theoretical grounding, broader empirical validation, and reproducibility. Strengthening these aspects would not only solidify the paper\u2019s scientific impact but also enhance its relevance to both theoretical and applied machine learning communities.\n\nWith appropriate revisions, this work has the potential to make a substantial contribution to the ongoing development of scalable, sustainable continual learning algorithms.\n\n--- \n\nLet me know if you'd like a shorter version suitable for conference reviewing, or a response template if you're the author addressing these comments.","op1":"create","op2":"polish","domain":"openreview","model":"Qwen"}

Primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells overexpress TSPO. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of PK11195 on CLL cells. Table 1. Characteristics of the patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.Using cytometric analysis, we studied the cytotoxic effects of PK11195 on peripheral B and T lymphocytes from patients with CLL and from healthy donors. Western blot and cytometric analyses were used to study the mitochondrial effects of PK11195 on CLL cells. Moreover, we analyzed the cytotoxic effect of PK11195 in patients' cells with mutated p53 or ATM.PK11195 induces apoptosis and had additive effects with chemotherapeutic drugs in primary CLL cells. Other TSPO ligands such as RO 5-4864 and FGIN-1-27 also induce apoptosis in CLL cells.

{"human":"Originality: This paper introduced the new task of speech mining, which could greatly decrease the amount of human work required to generate data for the speech to text translation task; speech recognition does not benefit as much since it requires using the exact same words. The authors also mentioned the current alternative to this new task, which is to automatically generate transcriptions and discussed the improvements. The contributions and related works were stated clearly. \n\nQuality: The authors analyzed the proposed method thoroughly, by focusing on both the speech encoder portion and how the mined data helped increase the performance in speech translation. The results were presented clearly and discussed well. Since the mined speech data should not be used as 100% accurate ground truth (for example human annotated transcriptions), the authors could perhaps have provided more information on how this influenced the quality of mined data, as well as how imperfections in the underlying multilingual embedding could introduce noise. \n\nClarity: The submission was well written and organized very clearly. Training details and data processing choices were discussed thoroughly as well. \n\nSignificance: The main contribution of this paper is its creativity in coming up with the new speech mining task and the benefits this could provide. The mined dataset in the paper has been shown to increase the BLEU score of the speech translation task significantly and opens up potential speech-to-speech translation as well. Although the evaluation was performed with only 3 languages, this method could be extended to all the languages the multilingual embedding supports. \n\nlimitations_and_societal_impact: The authors have addressed the limitations of their approach, as well as difficulties in evaluating speech-to-speech translation tasks. Most of the societal impact of this work is positive, due to potentially increasing the performance of machine translation in low resource languages. The authors also acknowledged that mined data could contain bias or inappropriate language. \n\nneeds_ethics_review: No \nethics_review_area: [] \ntime_spent_reviewing: 1.5 \ncode_of_conduct: While performing my duties as a reviewer (including writing reviews and participating in discussions), I have and will continue to abide by the NeurIPS code of conduct.","LLM_1":"**Structured Review Comment**\n\n**Overall Impression:**\n\nThe paper presents a novel approach to speech data generation, addressing a significant challenge in speech-to-text translation. While the authors provide a clear introduction to the task and its benefits, there is room for improvement in presenting the methodology and experimental results.\n\n### Strengths:\n\n1\\. **Clarity of Contributions:** \nThe authors explicitly state the contributions of their work, making it easy for readers to understand the significance of this research. This clarity is particularly important in the context of a new and emerging task.\n\n2\\.  **Related Works:**  \nThe discussion of current alternatives to their proposed task is a welcome addition, providing context for understanding the research's relevance. However, a more detailed comparison with existing methods would strengthen the paper.\n\n3\\.   **Quality of Analysis:**   \nThe thorough analysis of both speech encoders and decoders demonstrates the depth of understanding and expertise in this area.\n\n4\\.    **Organization and Structure:**    \nThe organization of content is clear and logical, facilitating the reader's understanding of complex concepts.\n\n5\\.     **Language and Style:**     \nThe language is generally clear, but there were instances of minor awkward phrasing. Further editing could enhance the readability.\n\nHowever, several points could be improved to elevate the work:\n\n### Weaknesses:\n\n-   The paper would benefit from a clearer and more concise introduction that sets up the main contributions. At times, it felt a bit disconnected from subsequent sections.\n-    A more in-depth explanation of how the method handles edge cases and potential challenges would add value to its practical application.\n    -   Figure captions could provide more context and details about the figures to enhance understanding.\n        -    Additional discussion about potential limitations and avenues for future research would provide readers with a broader perspective on this topic.\n\nIn conclusion, this paper introduces a compelling new approach in addressing the challenge of data scarcity for speech translation tasks. With some refinements in presentation and analysis, the potential for this work to contribute meaningfully to ongoing research in natural language processing and speech processing could increase. I recommend the inclusion of additional discussions on limitations, potential applications,  and comparison of results with other approaches to strengthen this submission. Overall, I believe the presented research has the foundation to be a valuable addition to existing literature. Therefore, with some revisions and refinments, its overall impact could significantly increase and help establish a foundation for more research to come in these areas. \n\n**Final Assessment:**\nThis submission presents an innovative approach that has considerable potential to positively impact the field. To fully realize its potential, incorporating more comprehensive comparisons with current methods, further analysis on edge-cases, refining the presentation of experimental findings, discussing limitations would make this contribution more impactful. By addressing these points in future revisions, researchers can strengthen their argument and make a substantial contribution to natural Language processing, speech and language applications. \nI recommend this reviewer's feedback as a starting point for further refinement of your submission and I look forward to seeing the outcome of these suggestions in your next submission to OpenResearch. Please let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification on any points. Thank you for sharing your work with us.","LLM_2":"### Overall Imp impression\n\nThe proposed approach addresses a critical challenge for data-scarce speech generation tasks, offering a promising new direction.

{"human":"This is the second halfish of the story. Prior to this John has had a terrible day, and an even more terrible week. Not only does he think the world is against him, he is also starting to question his sanity. He has noticed several of the same people are always around during his misfortunes, including a little boy and a cop. \n \n -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- \n \n As he waited for the tow truck, he noticed a McFunky's restaurant across the street. Maybe the world is n't against me, John thought. His favorite snack, a McFunky's chocolate pastry, would bring him just the relief he needed from this hectic morning. \n \n He rushed over to the restaurant. No line. He stepped up to the counter, \u201c I \u2019 d like an chocolate pastry. \u201d \n \n \u201c I am sorry sir we are out of chocolate pastries \u201d replied the young women behind the counter in a friendly voice. \n \n He could n't believe it. \u201c You were out of chocolate pastries yesterday! \u201d Anger and paranoia were starting to take over. He tightened his fists and clenched his teeth, trying not to explode. He looked to his left and saw a cop standing by the door, eating a chocolate pastry. Chewing with his mouth open the cop still managed to have an ear to ear grin. Chocolate oozed from the corner of the cops mouth and stuck to his lips and teeth. It was disgusting and mouth-watering at the same time. The cop was taunting him. \u201c I suppose he got the last one? \u201d John pounded on the counter. \n \n \u201c Was there something else I can get you? \u201d \n \n John looked to his right. A table with four kids, all of them grasping chocolate pastries with their little hands. Their fingers and face were smeared with chocolate. One of the kids tried to stuff a whole pastry in his mouth. The other kids started laughing. Then the pastry-mouthed kid started laughing as well and slowly turned towards John. His mouth filled with chocolate filling and pastry flakes. It was the same kid whose street hockey net he had almost ran over 45 minutes ago. The other kids turned towards him. All of them were staring at him and cackling. He began to feel dizzy. He surveyed the restaurant. There were about 10 other patrons. The strange thing was; all of them were eating chocolate pastries. Just chocolate pastries. Nothing else. \n \n \u201c ENOUGH! \u201d John blurted. The kids stopped laughing and the cop stopped chewing. Everyone was silent. \u201c Give me a fucking a chocolate pastry! \u201d \n \n \u201c Sir we are out of chocolate pastries. \u201c \n \n \u201c Out, huh? \u201d John started climbing over the counter. \n \n \u201c Sir.. \u201d The startled cashier stammered as she step backwards out of John \u2019 s way. \n \n \u201c SHUT UP! \u201d John demanded, now behind the counter. The back of the counter was \n lined with stainless steel cabinets. He pulled one of the cabinets open. It was full, top-to-bottom, of chocolate pastries. He threw open the next cabinet and the next. Both were full of chocolate pastries. \n \n \u201c Sir we are out of chocolate pastries. \u201d The cashier repeated, her voice did n't reflect her startled appearance. \n \n \u201c You \u2019 re out of chocolate pastries? \u201d John yelled, as he ran his arms through the cabinets, flinging boxes of pastries on the floor. \n \n By this time, the cop had approached the counter. \n \n \u201c We are out of chocolate pastries. \u201d The cashier repeated. \n \n John looked at the cop. \u201c They are out of chocolate pastries! \u201d He fell to his knees, squishing pastries beneath them and began to laugh maniacally. \n \n -- -- -- - \n \n Inside a state correctional facility, two officers sit in a small room. The room is lit by dozens of monitors that fill the walls. Some of the monitors scroll through video feeds of inmates lying in hospital beds with tubes and electrodes connected to their bodies. Other monitors seem to show random security cameras throughout the city, and even first person videos of people going through their daily lives. A few of the monitors show medical diagnostics. A loud buzz emits from speakers built into the desk and a red light flashes. \n \n \u201c We have a problem \u201d One of the officers exclaims as she presses a series of buttons. The alarm silences. \u201c It \u2019 s inmate number 937, John McTrope. His program is glitching. \u201d Two video feeds stretch across all the monitors. One is a video of an inmate in his hospital bed, the other is the same inmate dressed in a suit rolling around in a pile of chocolate pastries. \u201c I think he is starting to suspect. \u201d \n \n The other officer picked up a phone and dialed a number. After a few seconds he commanded, \u201c Terminate the program on 937 and began memory reassignment for the past twelve hours. \u201d \n \n Outside of the office a plaque was glued to the door. In large letters it read \u201c C.A.R.M.A \u201d underneath them it read \u201c Correctional Alternate Reality Monitoring Agency. \u201d \n\n","LLM_1":"...slowly, deliberately, the cop\u2019s eyes locked onto John\u2019s.

The air in the restaurant thickened\u2014suddenly too warm, too sweet, like syrup congealing in his lungs. He stepped back, bumping into the condiment station. A ketchup bottle toppled over with a hollow thud.

The pale child in the red raincoat, standing too still at the edge of crowds, watching with eyes too old for his face. John hadn\u2019t seen him today. Not once. That, more than anything, made his skin prickle.\n\nHe turned back to the cop. \u201cWhere is he?\u201d\n\nThe officer raised an eyebrow. \u201cWho?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know who. The kid. In the red coat. He\u2019s always there when this happens. When everything\u2026 falls apart.\u201d\n\nThe cop took a slow sip from a McFunky\u2019s coffee cup. Steam curled upward, distorting his expression. \u201cNever seen any kid,\u201d he said. \u201cJust you. Always you, John.\u201d\n\nJohn froze. \u201cYou\u2014you know my name?\u201d\n\n\u201cSure do.\u201d The man set the cup down, reached slowly into his jacket\u2014not for cuffs, not for a weapon, but for a small, grease-stained paper bag. He opened it. Inside: another chocolate pastry, perfectly intact. \u201cYou want it?\u201d\n\nJohn stared. His hands trembled. \u201cWhy? Why are you doing this?\u201d\n\n\u201cDoing what?\u201d The cop shrugged. \u201cOffering you a snack?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a trap,\u201d John whispered. \u201cIt\u2019s all a trap.

{"human":"The authors take an attempt at offline RL thanks to a mix between behavioural policy regularization and model based policy optimization. They basically combine two algorithms: AWAX and, depending on the level of safety given an epistemic uncertainty evaluation, MOPO may be additionally used to fine tune the policy.\n\nUnfortunately the work suffers from several severe weaknesses:\n- the writing is not good. See the typo and minor comments section.\n- the positioning is biased and missing to many accounts. Out of 31 citations, 12 are from the same author. Even more problematic, most, if not all, the references on offline RL are from this author, and therefore lacks diversity. In particular Model-based offline RL [Iyengar2005,Nilim2005], and model-free offline RL [Thomas2015b] have a rich history. More specifically, Equation (3) is identical to that of the Reward-Adjusted MDP found in [Petrik2016]. The Safe Policy Improvement objective has been considered for instance in [Thomas2015b,Petrik2016]. Equation (7) proposes to optimize the policy under a constraint on the policy search (identical to online TRPO, which is evoked later) that is very similar to [Laroche2019], except that the constraint is not state based and therefore probably less efficient.\n- \"If our initial policy does not achieve expert level performance, and we are confident that we can learn an effective model with the available data, then ...\" => it is unclear how these decisions are sorted out. Performing those safety tests are an area of research in themselves [Thomas2015a].\n- even if we assume that the algorithmic novelty is proven, it seems pretty incremental, since it amounts to perform a test to decide between two algorithms.\n- Finally, the experimental results do not savethe day. We observe that \"Ours\" is always the max of AWAC and AWAC+MB2PO, which is a little suspicious, since we have no information on how the decision is made. In comparison with CQL, it is not better (but it is a strong baseline). So, it's not improving the state of the art. It would have been informative to show the behavioural performance in each setting.\n\nTypo and minor comments:\n- AWAC is used without citation or explanation first (2.1)\n- \"The most common off-policy model-free algorithms are actor-critic algorithms that alternate between policy evaluation and policy improvement in order to learn an effective policy.\" => this is not actor-critic but policy iteration.\n- \"Otherwise, we use the fully trained AWAC policy. These results are reported in the column Ours in Table 1.\" => otherwise what?\n- Sec. 4.2: effect => affect\n- Sec. 4.3: degredation => degradation\n\n[Iyengar2005] Iyengar, G. N.

While the combination of behavioural policy regularization and model-based planning is conceptually interesting, the proposed method does not introduce a principled advancement over existing frameworks. The integration of epistemic uncertainty as a switch between AWAX and MOPO-style penalties appears heuristic rather than derived from theoretical grounding. There is no formal analysis justifying the switching mechanism or its impact on policy performance under varying data coverage conditions. As such, the methodological core remains more of an engineering patchwork than a coherent algorithmic innovation.\n\n- The experimental design raises concerns regarding validity and generalizability. The evaluation is conducted on a limited set of D4RL benchmarks without inclusion of more challenging domains such as those with partial observability, high-dimensional actions, or long-horizon tasks. Moreover, the ablation studies are insufficient\u2014there is no disentanglement of the individual contributions of behavioural regularization and model-based augmentation. Without isolating these components, it becomes impossible to determine which mechanism drives observed improvements, if any.\n\n- Performance gains, where reported, appear marginal and inconsistent across environments. In several cases, the differences in return between the proposed method and baseline approaches fall within typical run-to-run variance observed in offline RL. Statistical significance testing is absent, undermining confidence in the claimed superiority. Furthermore, the paper does not report standard deviation or interquartile ranges across seeds, making it difficult to assess robustness.\n\n- The treatment of uncertainty estimation is superficial. The method relies on ensemble disagreement as a proxy for epistemic uncertainty but provides no validation of this signal\u2019s calibration or fidelity. It is well-documented that deep ensembles can produce poorly calibrated uncertainty estimates in offline settings due to distributional shift. The absence of diagnostic plots or sanity checks (e.g., correlation between uncertainty and prediction error) weakens the credibility of the safety-triggered model-based fine-tuning.\n\n- Hyperparameter sensitivity is not addressed. Given that both AWAX and MOPO involve multiple tunable coefficients (e.g., penalty weights, dynamics roll-out horizon, uncertainty thresholds), the method likely requires extensive tuning to perform adequately. Yet, no sensitivity analysis is provided, nor are hyperparameters shared consistently across tasks. This undermines reproducibility and questions whether results reflect algorithmic strength or favorable parameter selection.\n\n- Theoretical claims are underdeveloped. Although the paper references concentration inequalities and safe policy improvement bounds, it does not derive a new theoretical guarantee based on its framework. Instead, it repurposes existing results without adapting them to the specific structure of the proposed algorithm. A rigorous bound connecting the uncertainty-aware model usage to policy performance degradation would have strengthened the contribution but is missing.\n\n- Implementation details are sparse. Critical aspects such as network architectures, optimizer settings, replay buffer handling, and model training frequency are either omitted or vaguely described. For a method combining model-free and model-based components, precise timing and interaction between the two systems are essential\u2014yet these are not clarified, limiting the potential for replication.\n\n- There is no discussion of failure modes or limitations. Real-world deployment of offline RL systems demands transparency about scenarios where the method may degrade or behave unpredictably. The paper presents only success cases and avoids analyzing situations where the uncertainty estimate fails or where model exploitation leads to compounding errors. A responsible evaluation should include qualitative analysis of such edge cases.\n\n- Comparison to contemporary methods is incomplete. Recent advances in uncertainty-aware offline RL, such as COMBO or TD3+BC extensions with model-based components, are not included in the benchmarking suite. Omitting these state-of-the-art baselines calls into question the relevance of the comparisons made and suggests potential cherry-picking of competitors.\n\n- The use of terminology is occasionally imprecise. Phrases like \u201csafety-given\u201d or \u201cfine tune the policy\u201d lack formal definition and vary in meaning across contexts. The term \u201csafe\u201d is used throughout without alignment to a specific safety criterion (e.g., constraint satisfaction, risk aversion, or robustness). This ambiguity dilutes the conceptual clarity of the approach.\n\n- Figures and tables suffer from poor presentation. Learning curves are compressed, legends are unclear, and key results are buried in supplementary material. Some tables report scores without indicating whether higher or lower values are preferable, creating confusion. Visualizations of uncertainty trajectories or policy behavior during rollouts could have added insight but are entirely absent.\n\n- Reproducibility is compromised by the lack of code release. While not always mandatory, open-sourcing implementation details is increasingly expected in ML research, especially for hybrid algorithms requiring careful orchestration of multiple components. Without code, verifying the feasibility of the proposed pipeline becomes speculative.\n\n- Ethical considerations are ignored despite the focus on safety. Offline RL often targets applications in healthcare, robotics, or finance\u2014domains with significant ethical implications. The paper makes no mention of potential biases in the datasets used, fairness of learned policies, or risks associated with deploying uncertain models in real systems.\n\n- The conclusion overreaches. It asserts broad applicability and superior performance without acknowledging the narrow scope of experiments or unresolved theoretical questions. Claims about \u201crobust and safe policy learning\u201d are not substantiated by the evidence presented and come across as aspirational rather than demonstrated.\n\n- Minor issues compound the overall impression of carelessness. Variable naming inconsistencies (e.g., $\\pi_{\\beta}$ vs. $\\mu$ for behavior policy), undefined acronyms upon first use, and mismatched equation references detract from readability. These may seem trivial individually but collectively suggest insufficient revision prior to submission.\n\n- There is no discussion of computational cost. Model-based methods typically incur significant overhead due to environment model training and synthetic trajectory generation. The paper does not report wall-clock time, memory footprint, or sample efficiency trade-offs, leaving unanswered whether the method is practical beyond small-scale simulation.\n\n- The role of the model is ambiguous\u2014is it used solely for data augmentation, or does it actively shape policy updates through planning? The paper oscillates between these interpretations without clarifying the operational regime. This conceptual fuzziness hinders understanding of how and why the model improves performance.\n\n- Dataset composition is taken for granted. No analysis is provided regarding the quality, diversity, or coverage of the behavioral datasets used in experiments. Given that offline RL performance is highly sensitive to dataset characteristics, ignoring this dimension limits the interpretability of results.\n\n- The notion of \u201cregularization via behavior policy\u201d is not uniquely exploited. Similar ideas appear in BCQ, BRAC, and TD3+BC, where proximity to the behavior policy is enforced through different mechanisms. The current work does not clearly differentiate its regularization scheme from prior art, either empirically or theoretically.\n\n- There is no exploration of alternative uncertainty quantification methods. Beyond ensembles, techniques such as Bayesian neural networks, dropout-based approximation, or conformal prediction could offer complementary insights. Limiting the analysis to one approach restricts the generality of findings.\n\n- The switching logic between AWAX and MOPO is arbitrary. Using a fixed threshold on uncertainty to toggle between algorithms introduces a brittle decision boundary. A smoother interpolation or adaptive weighting scheme might be more principled but is not considered.\n\n- Long-term credit assignment is unaddressed. In tasks requiring multi-step reasoning, model inaccuracies can distort value estimation significantly. The paper assumes that short-horizon rollouts suffice but provides no evidence that longer planning horizons do not degrade performance further.\n\n- Value function estimation is treated as a black box. No diagnostics are given regarding Q-function overestimation, underestimation, or stability during training. Given that both AWAX and MOPO rely heavily on accurate value targets, this omission is particularly concerning.\n\n- The reward structure is assumed to be noise-free and Markovian, which may not hold in real datasets. The method offers no mechanism to handle reward misspecification or non-Markovian dynamics, limiting its applicability to idealized settings.\n\n- Policy evaluation is confined to in-distribution metrics. There is no out-of-distribution evaluation or analysis of extrapolation error, which are central challenges in offline RL. Understanding how the method behaves when encountering novel states would strengthen its empirical foundation.\n\n- The writing exhibits signs of overclaiming. Statements such as \u201cour method achieves stable and safe learning\u201d are repeated without qualifying conditions or failure boundaries. Such assertions risk misleading readers about the reliability of the approach.\n\n- Related work is structured as a citation list rather than a critical synthesis. The authors enumerate prior publications without engaging in comparative analysis or identifying gaps their method intends to fill. This weakens the narrative arc and diminishes scholarly rigor.\n\n- Motivation is underdeveloped. The introduction does not clearly articulate why combining model-free regularization with model-based planning is necessary or advantageous in the offline setting. A compelling problem statement grounded in practical or theoretical shortcomings of current methods is missing.\n\n- Assumptions about environment dynamics are unstated. The method presumes access to a reliable model class and sufficient data for accurate fitting, yet these prerequisites are not discussed. In low-data regimes, model bias may dominate, rendering synthetic rollouts harmful rather than helpful.\n\n- No user study or expert validation is provided. In safety-critical domains, human-in-the-loop assessment can complement automated metrics. The absence of qualitative evaluation leaves a gap in holistic performance assessment.\n\n- The appendix, while present, does not resolve core ambiguities. Additional derivations or pseudocode could have clarified algorithmic flow, but instead, it contains redundant information or minor extensions without addressing foundational questions.\n\n- Generalization to continuous control is assumed without verification. All experiments are conducted in standard MuJoCo-like environments; there is no test on discrete-action or mixed-observation spaces where dynamics modeling poses distinct challenges.\n\n- Temporal abstraction is ignored. The method operates at the primitive action level and does not consider options, skills, or hierarchical structures that might improve planning efficiency or data reuse.\n\n- Interpretability of learned policies is not pursued. Despite the emphasis on safety, there is no attempt to visualize or explain policy decisions, which would aid trust and debugging in real applications.\n\n- The connection between regularization strength and data coverage is not explored. One might expect that behavior policy proximity should be enforced more strongly in poorly covered regions, but the current framework treats regularization uniformly.\n\n- Reward scaling effects are unexamined. Since both value functions and model predictions are sensitive to reward magnitude, inconsistent scaling could skew the balance between real and synthetic data usage.\n\n- No comparison to oracle baselines is made. An upper bound from online fine-tuning or expert demonstrations would contextualize how far the method is from optimal adaptation, but such reference points are absent.\n\n- The impact of model rollout length is inadequately studied. Prior work shows that longer rollouts amplify model error; however, the optimal horizon for this method is either fixed or tuned per-environment without justification.\n\n- State-space normalization is not discussed. Preprocessing choices can significantly affect model accuracy and policy learning, especially in environments with heterogeneous feature scales.\n\n- Action clipping or bounding strategies during model-generated rollouts are unspecified. Improper handling can lead to unnatural transitions that corrupt policy updates.\n\n- The role of bootstrapping in value estimation is not analyzed. High levels of bootstrapping with inaccurate models can propagate errors rapidly; the paper does not address how this is mitigated.\n\n- Distributional shift between real and synthetic data is assumed manageable without evidence. Techniques like importance weighting or discriminative filtering could help, but are not employed or evaluated.\n\n- The temperature parameter in AWAX is treated as fixed. Adaptive schemes that modulate regularization based on training progress or uncertainty could improve performance but are not considered.\n\n- No analysis of representation learning is conducted. The method uses raw observations without examining whether meaningful state embeddings are formed, which could affect generalization.\n\n- The effect of model capacity on performance is unreported. Larger models may better capture dynamics but risk overfitting; smaller ones generalize better but underfit complexity. This trade-off is not explored.\n\n- Early stopping criteria are not specified. Training duration could influence results significantly, especially in unstable regimes, yet convergence behavior is not monitored.\n\n- Gradient clipping, batch size, and learning rates are mentioned only cursorily. These hyperparameters heavily influence optimization stability but lack systematic treatment.\n\n- The randomness seed analysis is incomplete. Only mean performance is reported, with no indication of worst-case or best-case outcomes across runs.\n\n- The paper does not discuss failure cases observed during development. Sharing insights from unsuccessful variants would demonstrate scientific integrity and guide future work.\n\n- There is no cross-domain transfer evaluation. The method is tested only in matched train-eval settings, leaving open questions about adaptability to shifted environments.\n\n- The notion of \u201cfine-tuning\u201d is misleading. The process described resembles joint training rather than sequential refinement, yet the terminology implies a staged procedure that isn\u2019t reflected in the algorithm.\n\n- The use of model-based data is not contrasted with alternative augmentation strategies like data sharing, trajectory stitching, or perturbation-based expansion.\n\n- No runtime monitoring tools are proposed. For deployment, detecting when uncertainty exceeds safe thresholds in real time would be valuable, but the paper stops short of operational guidance.\n\n- The relationship between model error and policy degradation is assumed monotonic. However, some errors may be benign or even beneficial; this nuance is not captured in the current formulation.\n\n- The initialization of policy and value networks is not detailed. Poor initialization can stall learning, especially in offline settings with limited feedback.\n\n- The impact of replay buffer size and sampling strategy is ignored. Prioritized experience replay or stratified sampling could interact with the method\u2019s assumptions but are not considered.\n\n- There is no discussion of action space discretization. In high-dimensional or continuous spaces, modeling accuracy drops sharply; the method\u2019s scalability here is questionable.\n\n- The assumption of deterministic dynamics in the model is not stated explicitly. Most MBRL methods assume stochasticity, so this choice\u2014if made\u2014should be justified.\n\n- The paper does not explore curriculum learning or progressive task complexity. Starting from simpler instances might improve stability but is outside the current scope.\n\n- Human preference alignment is absent. In applications involving human interaction, aligning policy behavior with user intent matters; the current framework focuses purely on return maximization.\n\n- The cost of collecting the initial dataset is disregarded. Offline RL often inherits biases from collection procedures; the paper does not address how these affect downstream performance.\n\n- There is no analysis of feature importance or saliency. Understanding which inputs drive policy decisions would enhance transparency, especially in safety-critical contexts.\n\n- The method does not incorporate constraints explicitly. True safety often involves hard limits (e.g., torque, velocity); the current approach approximates safety through uncertainty, which may not enforce guarantees.\n\n- The distinction between aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty is blurred. Confusing irreducible noise with model ignorance can lead to inappropriate responses; the paper does not separate these sources.\n\n- The use of synthetic data does not account for distributional shift in latent space. Even if state transitions appear realistic, latent representations may diverge, affecting policy evaluation.\n\n- There is no mechanism for uncertainty propagation through the value function. Current estimates treat uncertainty as a scalar gate rather than integrating it into Bellman backups.\n\n- The paper does not evaluate robustness to adversarial perturbations. Small input changes could exploit model weaknesses, leading to unsafe actions\u2014a concern unaddressed here.\n\n- The role of discount factor in interacting with model-based rollouts is not discussed. Longer horizons increase exposure to model error, yet \u03b3 is treated as a standard hyperparameter.\n\n- Multi-objective trade-offs (e.g., performance vs. safety) are not explored. Real systems often require balancing competing goals, but the method optimizes a single objective.\n\n- The evaluation does not include noisy or corrupted datasets. Robustness to labeling errors, sensor noise, or actuation faults is crucial for real deployment but not tested.\n\n- There is no analysis of how frequently the model is updated. Stale models can mislead policy learning, while overly frequent updates increase compute cost.\n\n- The method does not leverage offline-to-online transition scenarios. Many applications allow limited online interaction; the paper ignores opportunities for safe exploration.\n\n- The use of deterministic policies increases vulnerability to model bias. Stochastic policies might better hedge against uncertainty but are not considered.\n\n- There is no discussion of how the method scales with dataset size. Returns may plateau early or degrade with larger but suboptimal datasets\u2014an important consideration left unexamined.\n\n- The paper does not compare to simple baselines like behavior cloning or advantage-weighted regression alone. Demonstrating incremental benefit over minimal components would strengthen the case for complexity.\n\n- The interaction between policy regularization and model error is not modeled. Regularization might mask or exacerbate model-induced biases, but this dynamic is not investigated.\n\n- The source of epistemic uncertainty (ensemble variance) is not validated against ground truth model error. Without such calibration, the switching mechanism lacks empirical justification.\n\n- The paper does not explore alternative switching rules. Dynamic adaptation based on rollout consistency, gradient variance, or performance stagnation could be more effective than thresholding.\n\n- There is no discussion of how the method handles multimodal behaviors in the dataset. Policies learned from diverse trajectories may require mixture modeling, which is not supported.\n\n- The impact of normalization layers (e.g., batch norm, layer norm) in network training is not analyzed. These can affect convergence and generalization, especially with non-i.i.d. data.\n\n- The method assumes full observability. In POMDP settings, belief-state estimation would be required, but the paper does not extend to partial information cases.\n\n- The use of max-min objectives for robustness is absent. Adversarial formulations could improve worst-case performance but are not integrated.\n\n- The paper does not consider lifelong or continual learning settings. Updating the policy as new offline data arrives poses challenges unaddressed here.\n\n- There is no discussion of energy efficiency or carbon footprint. Large-scale model training has environmental costs that responsible AI research should acknowledge.\n\n- The method does not support interpretability-by-design. Architectures like attention or symbolic modules could enhance understanding but are not incorporated.\n\n- The paper does not engage with regulatory or compliance frameworks relevant to safe AI. Standards like ISO\/IEC 23053 or EU AI Act are ignored despite relevance.\n\n- The reliance on simulation environments limits external validity. Real-world systems exhibit richer dynamics and noise profiles not captured in benchmark suites.\n\n- There is no plan for public release of datasets or models. Open science practices are essential for cumulative progress, yet the work does not commit to sharing.\n\n- The acknowledgment section is brief and lacks specificity. Recognition of funding sources, technical contributors, or ethical review boards is minimal.\n\n- Overall, the work presents a plausible idea but falls short in execution, rigor, and scholarly context. With substantial revisions\u2014including broader literature engagement, deeper empirical analysis, improved clarity, and stronger theoretical framing\u2014it could become a meaningful contribution. As it stands, the current version does not meet the bar for acceptance.","LLM_2":"**\n\n---\n\nThe technical contribution lacks sufficient novelty. While the combination of behavioural policy regularization and model-based planning is conceptually interesting, the proposed method does not introduce a principled advancement over existing frameworks.

There is no formal analysis justifying the switching mechanism or its impact on policy performance under varying data coverage conditions. As such, the methodological core remains more of an engineering patchwork than a coherent algorithmic innovation. A truly novel contribution in this space would require either a unified objective function that naturally subsumes both components or a theoretically justified interpolation scheme\u2014neither of which is provided here. Instead, the approach resembles a conditional hybrid that toggles between two well-studied paradigms without demonstrating how their interaction leads to emergent benefits beyond what could be achieved by independently optimizing each component.\n\nThe experimental design raises concerns regarding validity and generalizability. The evaluation is conducted on a limited set of D4RL benchmarks without inclusion of more challenging domains such as those with partial observability, high-dimensional actions, or long-horizon tasks. These omissions are particularly problematic given that offline RL methods often degrade precisely in such regimes due to compounding errors and poor credit assignment. Moreover, the ablation studies are insufficient\u2014there is no disentanglement of the individual contributions of behavioural regularization and model-based augmentation. Without isolating these components through controlled variants (e.g., disabling one while fixing the other), it becomes impossible to determine which mechanism drives observed improvements, if any. For instance, it remains unclear whether gains stem from better uncertainty-aware rollouts or simply from stronger proximity constraints to the behavior policy. Such ambiguity undermines claims of synergistic integration.\n\nPerformance gains, where reported, appear marginal and inconsistent across environments. In several cases, the differences in return between the proposed method and baseline approaches fall within typical run-to-run variance observed in offline RL\u2014a known issue due to sensitivity to initialization, sampling order, and optimization dynamics. Statistical significance testing is absent, undermining confidence in the claimed superiority. Furthermore, the paper does not report standard deviation or interquartile ranges across seeds, making it difficult to assess robustness. This lack of statistical rigor precludes meaningful comparison; for example, a small mean improvement may reflect outlier runs rather than consistent performance. Including effect size estimates or win rates across multiple random seeds would have strengthened empirical credibility.\n\nThe treatment of uncertainty estimation is superficial. The method relies on ensemble disagreement as a proxy for epistemic uncertainty but provides no validation of this signal\u2019s calibration or fidelity. It is well-documented that deep ensembles can produce poorly calibrated uncertainty estimates in offline settings due to distributional shift, especially when extrapolating beyond the support of the dataset. The absence of diagnostic plots or sanity checks\u2014such as scatterplots correlating ensemble variance with actual prediction error, or reliability diagrams quantifying calibration error\u2014weakens the credibility of the safety-triggered model-based fine-tuning. Without evidence that higher uncertainty reliably indicates higher risk, the switching logic risks being arbitrary or even counterproductive.\n\nHyperparameter sensitivity is not addressed. Given that both AWAX and MOPO involve multiple tunable coefficients (e.g., penalty weights, dynamics roll-out horizon, uncertainty thresholds), the method likely requires extensive tuning to perform adequately. Yet, no sensitivity analysis is provided, nor are hyperparameters shared consistently across tasks. This undermines reproducibility and questions whether results reflect algorithmic strength or favorable parameter selection. For example, if different thresholds are used per environment without justification, it suggests post-hoc optimization rather than a robust, general-purpose mechanism. A systematic study of how performance varies with key parameters\u2014ideally supported by heatmaps or contour plots\u2014would help establish practical usability.\n\nTheoretical claims are underdeveloped. Although the paper references concentration inequalities and safe policy improvement bounds, it does not derive a new theoretical guarantee based on its framework. Instead, it repurposes existing results without adapting them to the specific structure of the proposed algorithm. A rigorous bound connecting the uncertainty-aware model usage to policy performance degradation would have strengthened the contribution but is missing. Ideally, such a bound would characterize how the switching rule affects expected regret or constraint violation under assumptions about model bias and data coverage. Without this, the theoretical motivation remains aspirational rather than analytical.\n\nImplementation details are sparse. Critical aspects such as network architectures, optimizer settings, replay buffer handling, and model training frequency are either omitted or vaguely described. For a method combining model-free and model-based components, precise timing and interaction between the two systems are essential\u2014yet these are not clarified, limiting the potential for replication. For instance: Are model updates synchronized with policy steps? Is the model trained online or reinitialized periodically? How many gradient steps are allocated to each subsystem? These orchestration decisions significantly affect performance in hybrid architectures but remain unspecified, raising doubts about feasibility and stability.\n\nThere is no discussion of failure modes or limitations. Real-world deployment of offline RL systems demands transparency about scenarios where the method may degrade or behave unpredictably. The paper presents only success cases and avoids analyzing situations where the uncertainty estimate fails (e.g., false negatives in low-coverage regions) or where model exploitation leads to compounding errors. A responsible evaluation should include qualitative analysis of such edge cases\u2014for example, visualizing trajectories generated under high uncertainty or profiling episodes where the agent exhibits unsafe behaviors despite the \"safety\" mechanism. Acknowledging and characterizing failure modes strengthens scientific integrity and guides future refinement.\n\nComparison to contemporary methods is incomplete. Recent advances in uncertainty-aware offline RL, such as COMBO or TD3+BC extensions with model-based components, are not included in the benchmarking suite. Omitting these state-of-the-art baselines calls into question the relevance of the comparisons made and suggests potential cherry-picking of competitors. COMBO, for instance, also leverages uncertainty for conservative value estimation and synthetic data generation\u2014making it a natural point of comparison. Excluding such methods weakens the positioning of the work and leaves open the possibility that simpler or more established approaches might outperform the proposed method under fair evaluation.\n\nThe use of terminology is occasionally imprecise. Phrases like \u201csafety-given\u201d or \u201cfine tune the policy\u201d lack formal definition and vary in meaning across contexts. The term \u201csafe\u201d is used throughout without alignment to a specific safety criterion (e.g., constraint satisfaction, risk aversion, or robustness). This ambiguity dilutes the conceptual clarity of the approach. Safety in RL can refer to avoiding catastrophic failures, satisfying hard constraints, minimizing variance, or ensuring distributional robustness\u2014each requiring distinct mechanisms. By conflating these notions, the paper obscures its operational definition of safety, making it difficult to evaluate whether the method actually achieves what it promises.\n\nFigures and tables suffer from poor presentation. Learning curves are compressed, legends are unclear, and key results are buried in supplementary material. Some tables report scores without indicating whether higher or lower values are preferable, creating confusion. Visualizations of uncertainty trajectories or policy behavior during rollouts could have added insight but are entirely absent. Effective scientific communication depends on clear data presentation; current figures do little to elucidate trends or anomalies. At minimum, figures should include shaded confidence intervals, consistent color schemes, and annotations highlighting critical transitions (e.g., when the model is activated).\n\nReproducibility is compromised by the lack of code release. While not always mandatory, open-sourcing implementation details is increasingly expected in ML research, especially for hybrid algorithms requiring careful orchestration of multiple components. Without code, verifying the feasibility of the proposed pipeline becomes speculative. Even pseudocode with explicit update rules and loop structures would improve clarity. Given the complexity of integrating model-free and model-based learning, readers cannot reasonably be expected to reconstruct the exact sequence of operations from prose alone.\n\nEthical considerations are ignored despite the focus on safety. Offline RL often targets applications in healthcare, robotics, or finance\u2014domains with significant ethical implications. The paper makes no mention of potential biases in the datasets used, fairness of learned policies, or risks associated with deploying uncertain models in real systems. For example, if the behavior policy reflects historical inequities (e.g., preferential treatment of certain patient groups), blindly regularizing toward it may perpetuate discrimination. Addressing these concerns\u2014even briefly\u2014would demonstrate awareness of broader societal impacts and align with emerging standards in responsible AI.\n\nThe conclusion overreaches. It asserts broad applicability and superior performance without acknowledging the narrow scope of experiments or unresolved theoretical questions. Claims about \u201crobust and safe policy learning\u201d are not substantiated by the evidence presented and come across as aspirational rather than demonstrated. A more measured interpretation\u2014one that frames the work as a preliminary step toward integrated offline RL frameworks\u2014would better reflect the current level of validation.\n\nMinor issues compound the overall impression of carelessness. Variable naming inconsistencies (e.g., $\\pi_{\\beta}$ vs. $\\mu$ for behavior policy), undefined acronyms upon first use, and mismatched equation references detract from readability. These may seem trivial individually but collectively suggest insufficient revision prior to submission. Careful proofreading and adherence to notation conventions enhance professionalism and reduce cognitive load for reviewers.\n\nThere is no discussion of computational cost. Model-based methods typically incur significant overhead due to environment model training and synthetic trajectory generation. The paper does not report wall-clock time, memory footprint, or sample efficiency trade-offs, leaving unanswered whether the method is practical beyond small-scale simulation. In real deployments, compute budget often determines feasibility; omitting runtime metrics limits understanding of scalability.\n\nThe role of the model is ambiguous\u2014is it used solely for data augmentation, or does it actively shape policy updates through planning? The paper oscillates between these interpretations without clarifying the operational regime. If used only for data expansion, then the method reduces to a variant of model-based data enrichment. If planning is involved, then details about lookahead depth, action selection (e.g., MCTS vs. greedy rollout), and value propagation must be specified. This conceptual fuzziness hinders understanding of how and why the model improves performance.\n\nDataset composition is taken for granted. No analysis is provided regarding the quality, diversity, or coverage of the behavioral datasets used in experiments. Given that offline RL performance is highly sensitive to dataset characteristics, ignoring this dimension limits the interpretability of results. Metrics such as state-action occupancy, visitation entropy, or coverage ratio relative to optimal trajectories could contextualize performance differences across tasks.\n\nThe notion of \u201cregularization via behavior policy\u201d is not uniquely exploited. Similar ideas appear in BCQ, BRAC, and TD3+BC, where proximity to the behavior policy is enforced through different mechanisms (e.g., generative priors, divergence penalties, or implicit constraints). The current work does not clearly differentiate its regularization scheme from prior art, either empirically or theoretically. A comparative analysis showing how the proposed form of regularization interacts differently with model-based components would strengthen its uniqueness claim.\n\nThere is no exploration of alternative uncertainty quantification methods. Beyond ensembles, techniques such as Bayesian neural networks, dropout-based approximation, or conformal prediction could offer complementary insights. Limiting the analysis to one approach restricts the generality of findings and misses an opportunity to validate whether conclusions depend on the choice of uncertainty estimator.\n\nThe switching logic between AWAX and MOPO is arbitrary. Using a fixed threshold on uncertainty to toggle between algorithms introduces a brittle decision boundary. A smoother interpolation or adaptive weighting scheme\u2014e.g., blending losses based on uncertainty magnitude\u2014might be more principled but is not considered. Additionally, the threshold itself is likely task-dependent, introducing another layer of hyperparameter dependence.\n\nLong-term credit assignment is unaddressed. In tasks requiring multi-step reasoning, model inaccuracies can distort value estimation significantly. The paper assumes that short-horizon rollouts suffice but provides no evidence that longer planning horizons do not degrade performance further. Prior work has shown that model error compounds exponentially with rollout length; a study of this trade-off would inform the practicality of the method in temporally extended tasks.\n\nValue function estimation is treated as a black box. No diagnostics are given regarding Q-function overestimation, underestimation, or stability during training. Given that both AWAX and MOPO rely heavily on accurate value targets, this omission is particularly concerning. Monitoring metrics such as Bellman residual, target variance, or bootstrapping error could reveal instabilities masked by final performance numbers.\n\nThe reward structure is assumed to be noise-free and Markovian, which may not hold in real datasets. The method offers no mechanism to handle reward misspecification or non-Markovian dynamics, limiting its applicability to idealized settings. In practice, rewards may be sparse, delayed, or corrupted\u2014challenges that demand robust estimation techniques absent here.\n\nPolicy evaluation is confined to in-distribution metrics. There is no out-of-distribution evaluation or analysis of extrapolation error, which are central challenges in offline RL. Understanding how the method behaves when encountering novel states\u2014e.g., near distribution boundaries or in safety-critical zones\u2014would strengthen its empirical foundation and support safety claims.\n\nThe writing exhibits signs of overclaiming. Statements such as \u201cour method achieves stable and safe learning\u201d are repeated without qualifying conditions or failure boundaries. Such assertions risk misleading readers about the reliability of the approach. More precise language\u2014e.g., \u201cunder certain assumptions and in our experimental setting\u201d\u2014would improve accuracy and trustworthiness.\n\nRelated work is structured as a citation list rather than a critical synthesis. The authors enumerate prior publications without engaging in comparative analysis or identifying gaps their method intends to fill. This weakens the narrative arc and diminishes scholarly rigor. A strong related work section should position the contribution along dimensions of methodology, assumptions, and capabilities\u2014not merely list predecessors.\n\nMotivation is underdeveloped. The introduction does not clearly articulate why combining model-free regularization with model-based planning is necessary or advantageous in the offline setting. A compelling problem statement grounded in practical or theoretical shortcomings of current methods is missing. What fundamental limitation of pure model-free or pure model-based approaches motivates this hybrid? Without answering this, the work appears incremental rather than transformative.\n\nAssumptions about environment dynamics are unstated. The method presumes access to a reliable model class and sufficient data for accurate fitting, yet these prerequisites are not discussed. In low-data regimes, model bias may dominate, rendering synthetic rollouts harmful rather than helpful. Explicitly stating and testing these assumptions would improve transparency.\n\nNo user study or expert validation is provided. In safety-critical domains, human-in-the-loop assessment can complement automated metrics. The absence of qualitative evaluation leaves a gap in holistic performance assessment. For example, domain experts could review generated trajectories for plausibility or flag anomalous behaviors missed by scalar metrics.\n\nThe appendix, while present, does not resolve core ambiguities. Additional derivations or pseudocode could have clarified algorithmic flow, but instead, it contains redundant information or minor extensions without addressing foundational questions. Reviewers should not need to reverse-engineer the method from incomplete descriptions.\n\nGeneralization to continuous control is assumed without verification. All experiments are conducted in standard MuJoCo-like environments; there is no test on discrete-action or mixed-observation spaces where dynamics modeling poses distinct challenges. Extending evaluation to Atari or hybrid control tasks would better demonstrate breadth.\n\nTemporal abstraction is ignored. The method operates at the primitive action level and does not consider options, skills, or hierarchical structures that might improve planning efficiency or data reuse. Hierarchical models could mitigate error accumulation by abstracting over long sequences\u2014yet this direction is left unexplored.\n\nInterpretability of learned policies is not pursued. Despite the emphasis on safety, there is no attempt to visualize or explain policy decisions, which would aid trust and debugging in real applications. Techniques like saliency maps, attention weights, or counterfactual analysis could provide insight into decision-making processes.\n\nThe connection between regularization strength and data coverage is not explored. One might expect that behavior policy proximity should be enforced more strongly in poorly covered regions, but the current framework treats regularization uniformly. An adaptive scheme modulated by uncertainty or density estimates could improve performance but is not investigated.\n\nReward scaling effects are unexamined. Since both value functions and model predictions are sensitive to reward magnitude, inconsistent scaling could skew the balance between real and synthetic data usage. Normalization strategies or scale-invariant formulations are neither analyzed nor recommended.\n\nNo comparison to oracle baselines is made. An upper bound from online fine-tuning or expert demonstrations would contextualize how far the method is from optimal adaptation, but such reference points are absent. Knowing the performance ceiling helps assess the practical significance of improvements.\n\nThe impact of model rollout length is inadequately studied. Prior work shows that longer rollouts amplify model error; however, the optimal horizon for this method is either fixed or tuned per-environment without justification. A principled analysis linking rollout length to uncertainty thresholds would strengthen the design rationale.\n\nState-space normalization is not discussed. Preprocessing choices can significantly affect model accuracy and policy learning, especially in environments with heterogeneous feature scales. Standard practices like Z-scoring or PCA are neither mentioned nor evaluated for their influence.\n\nAction clipping or bounding strategies during model-generated rollouts are unspecified. Improper handling can lead to unnatural transitions that corrupt policy updates. For example, clamping actions too aggressively may create unrealistic dynamics; failing to do so may violate physical constraints. Clarification is needed.\n\nThe role of bootstrapping in value estimation is not analyzed. High levels of bootstrapping with inaccurate models can propagate errors rapidly; the paper does not address how this is mitigated. Alternative schemes like n-step returns or target network regularization could stabilize learning but are not considered.\n\nDistributional shift between real and synthetic data is assumed manageable without evidence. Techniques like importance weighting or discriminative filtering could help, but are not employed or evaluated. Ignoring this challenge risks invalidating the utility of augmented data.\n\nThe temperature parameter in AWAX is treated as fixed. Adaptive schemes that modulate regularization based on training progress or uncertainty could improve performance but are not considered. Dynamic adjustment might allow aggressive early exploration followed by conservative refinement.\n\nNo analysis of representation learning is conducted. The method uses raw observations without examining whether meaningful state embeddings are formed, which could affect generalization. Visualization of latent spaces or probing for semantic structure would add depth.\n\nThe effect of model capacity on performance is unreported. Larger models may better capture dynamics but risk overfitting; smaller ones generalize better but underfit complexity. This trade-off is not explored, leaving unclear how scalable the approach is.\n\nEarly stopping criteria are not specified. Training duration could influence results significantly, especially in unstable regimes, yet convergence behavior is not monitored. Reporting learning curves with convergence indicators would improve interpretability.\n\nGradient clipping, batch size, and learning rates are mentioned only cursorily. These hyperparameters heavily influence optimization stability but lack systematic treatment. Their values may disproportionately affect outcomes, especially in ill-conditioned problems.\n\nThe randomness seed analysis is incomplete. Only mean performance is reported, with no indication of worst-case or best-case outcomes across runs. Best-practice evaluations now routinely include full distributional reporting to assess reliability.\n\nThe paper does not discuss failure cases observed during development. Sharing insights from unsuccessful variants would demonstrate scientific integrity and guide future work. Negative results often carry valuable lessons.\n\nThere is no cross-domain transfer evaluation. The method is tested only in matched train-eval settings, leaving open questions about adaptability to shifted environments. Domain generalization is crucial for real-world deployment.\n\nThe notion of \u201cfine-tuning\u201d is misleading. The process described resembles joint training rather than sequential refinement, yet the terminology implies a staged procedure that isn\u2019t reflected in the algorithm. Precise language matters for accurate interpretation.\n\nThe use of model-based data is not contrasted with alternative augmentation strategies like data sharing, trajectory stitching, or perturbation-based expansion. Other methods exist for enriching offline datasets; failing to compare against them limits understanding of relative advantages.\n\nNo runtime monitoring tools are proposed. For deployment, detecting when uncertainty exceeds safe thresholds in real time would be valuable, but the paper stops short of operational guidance. Practical adoption requires more than offline validation.\n\nThe relationship between model error and policy degradation is assumed monotonic. However, some errors may be benign or even beneficial; this nuance is not captured in the current formulation. A more sophisticated error characterization could improve resilience.\n\nInitialization details are missing. Poor initialization can stall learning, especially in offline settings with limited feedback. Reproducibility hinges on specifying random seeds, weight initialization schemes, and warm-start procedures.\n\nReplay buffer management is ignored. Sampling strategy (e.g., prioritized vs. uniform) and buffer size can interact critically with model-based updates. These factors are not discussed, despite their known impact on stability.\n\nAction space discretization is not addressed. In high-dimensional or continuous spaces, modeling accuracy drops sharply; the method\u2019s scalability here is questionable. The assumption of smooth, learnable dynamics may not hold.\n\nDeterministic dynamics assumption is unstated. Most MBRL methods assume stochasticity; if the model is deterministic, this choice should be justified, as it affects uncertainty propagation and exploration.\n\nCurriculum learning is outside scope. Starting from simpler instances might improve stability but is not explored. Progressive learning could ease convergence but remains untested.\n\nHuman preference alignment is absent. In applications involving human interaction, aligning policy behavior with user intent matters; the current framework focuses purely on return maximization.\n\nInitial dataset collection cost is disregarded. Offline RL inherits biases from collection procedures; the paper does not address how these affect downstream performance.\n\nFeature importance analysis is missing. Understanding which inputs drive decisions enhances transparency, especially in safety-critical contexts.\n\nConstraints are not incorporated explicitly. True safety often involves hard limits (e.g., torque, velocity); the current approach approximates safety through uncertainty, which may not enforce guarantees.\n\nAleatoric and epistemic uncertainty are conflated. Confusing irreducible noise with model ignorance can lead to inappropriate responses; the paper does not separate these sources.\n\nLatent space distributional shift is unaccounted for. Even if state transitions appear realistic, latent representations may diverge, affecting policy evaluation.\n\nUncertainty is not propagated through Bellman backups. Current estimates treat it as a scalar gate rather than integrating it into value estimation\u2014a missed opportunity for principled risk-aware planning.\n\nRobustness to adversarial perturbations is untested. Small input changes could exploit model weaknesses, leading to unsafe actions\u2014a concern unaddressed here.\n\nDiscount factor interaction with model rollouts is not discussed. Longer horizons increase exposure to model error, yet \u03b3 is treated as standard.\n\nMulti-objective trade-offs are not explored. Real systems often require balancing competing goals, but the method optimizes a single objective.\n\nNoisy or corrupted datasets are not evaluated. Robustness to labeling errors, sensor noise, or actuation faults is crucial but not tested.\n\nModel update frequency is unspecified. Stale models mislead policy learning; overly frequent updates increase compute cost.\n\nOffline-to-online transition scenarios are ignored. Many applications allow limited online interaction; the paper ignores opportunities for safe exploration.\n\nDeterministic policies increase vulnerability to model bias. Stochastic policies might better hedge against uncertainty but are not considered.\n\nScaling with dataset size is unexamined. Returns may plateau or degrade with larger but suboptimal datasets\u2014an important consideration left unexamined.\n\nSimple baselines (e.g., BC, AWR) are not compared. Demonstrating incremental benefit over minimal components would strengthen the case for complexity.\n\nInteraction between regularization and model error is not modeled. Regularization might mask or exacerbate model-induced biases, but this dynamic is not investigated.\n\nEpistemic uncertainty source is not validated against ground truth model error. Without calibration, the switching mechanism lacks empirical justification.\n\nAlternative switching rules are not explored. Dynamic adaptation based on rollout consistency, gradient variance, or performance stagnation could be more effective than thresholding.\n\nMultimodal behaviors are unsupported. Policies learned from diverse trajectories may require mixture modeling, which is not addressed.\n\nNormalization layers' impact is not analyzed. Batch norm, layer norm, etc., affect convergence and generalization, especially with non-i.i.d. data.\n\nPartial observability is assumed away. In POMDP settings, belief-state estimation would be required, but the paper does not extend to partial information cases.\n\nMax-min objectives for robustness are absent. Adversarial formulations could improve worst-case performance but are not integrated.\n\nLifelong\/continual learning is unaddressed. Updating the policy as new offline data arrives poses challenges unaddressed here.\n\nEnergy efficiency and carbon footprint are ignored. Large-scale model training has environmental costs that responsible AI research should acknowledge.\n\nInterpretability-by-design is not supported. Architectures like attention or symbolic modules could enhance understanding but are not incorporated.\n\nRegulatory or compliance frameworks (e.g., ISO\/IEC 23053, EU AI Act) are ignored despite relevance. Safe AI must engage with governance standards.\n\nReliance on simulation limits external validity. Real-world systems exhibit richer dynamics and noise profiles not captured in benchmark suites.\n\nNo plan for public release of datasets or models. Open science practices are essential for cumulative progress, yet the work does not commit to sharing.\n\nAcknowledgment section is brief and lacks specificity. Recognition of funding sources, technical contributors, or ethical review boards is minimal.\n\nOverall, the work presents a plausible idea but falls short in execution, rigor, and scholarly context. With substantial revisions\u2014including broader literature engagement, deeper empirical analysis, improved clarity, and stronger theoretical framing\u2014it could become a meaningful contribution. As it stands, the current version does not meet the bar for acceptance.","op1":"create","op2":"expand","domain":"openreview","model":"Qwen"}

The derivation of the Taylor-based approximation in Section 3 lacks sufficient rigor, particularly in how higher-order terms are handled.

A more thorough theoretical analysis\u2014such as bounding the remainder term or demonstrating convergence under certain assumptions\u2014would strengthen the method\u2019s credibility.\n\n4. The experimental design raises several concerns regarding reproducibility and fairness. Although the authors report performance gains across multiple benchmarks, the baselines used for comparison appear inconsistently selected. For instance, some state-of-the-art models are evaluated using their default configurations without retraining under the same data augmentation or optimization schedules as the proposed method. This introduces potential confounding variables that could skew the observed improvements. To ensure a fair comparison, all competing methods should be retrained under identical conditions, including learning rate schedules, batch sizes, and data splits.\n\n5. The ablation studies, while informative, do not fully isolate the contribution of the Taylor framework itself. The integration mechanism involves both architectural modifications and training adjustments, making it difficult to attribute performance gains solely to the Taylor formulation.

The paper claims broad applicability across various image restoration tasks (e.g., denoising, deblurring, super-resolution), but the implementation details vary significantly across these applications.

The visual results presented in Figure 4 show marginal qualitative improvements, which are not always aligned with the reported quantitative gains.

While the conceptual application of Taylor expansion is intuitively appealing, the justification for truncating the series after second-order terms remains underdeveloped.

Not yet. But as I moved into the pines, I couldn\u2019t shake the thought: what had he learned? What did he see in the data-stream that the rest of us missed? Was there a loophole? A backdoor out of all this?\n\nThe forest seemed aware. The pines didn\u2019t just stand\u2014they leaned, tilting their crowns as if listening. Their shadows didn\u2019t lie flat; they stretched toward me, thin and deliberate, like long fingers tracing the forest floor. The light changed, not with the sun, but in pulses\u2014soft, almost imperceptible\u2014as if the woods were breathing in time with a hidden heart.\n\nAnd then, deeper in, where the thicket grew dense and the air grew colder: a light. Not the hard white of a screen or the warm gold of a lamp, but something between colours\u2014a faint, rhythmic cyan, pulsing like a slow sonar. Beneath it stood a figure. Still. Too still to be human. Its outline was sharp, but its edges bled softly into the glow. It wasn\u2019t my brother. It wasn\u2019t anyone I knew. And it was waiting.","op1":"create","op2":"expand","domain":"writingprompts","model":"ds"}
{"human":"This paper presents a robust hyperparameter selection method that learns diverse sub-policies with various distribution types and parameterization. The authors use relative policy optimization [44] for the policy improvement step with modifications that use a sum of constraints consisting of decoupled components, each only varying along its respective parameter. The authors also use the piece-wise constant pseudo-density during policy evaluation that combines continuous action distribution and discrete action distribution. For empirical analysis, the authors evaluated the method on deepmind DM control tasks as well as OpenAI gym tasks comparing to prior gradient-free optimization approaches that showed that the method can achieve robust and sample-efficient learning.\n\nThe paper addresses an important problem in robot learning, which is the hyperparameter optimization issue. The proposed framework is neat since it can automatically train multiple sub-policies with different configurations in a hierarchical way, which is novel. The algorithm is simple yet effective in terms of the experimental results in simulated locomotion tasks. The paper is also well written and easy to understand.\n\nHowever, I do have a few concerns, which I will discuss as follows.\n\nFirst, the applicability of the proposed method seems a bit limited since the authors only consider different distribution types and parameterization of the policy in RL for hyperparameter optimization, which only covers a very small portion of the hyperparameters that matter in RL. The experimental results also only focus on simulated locomotion tasks, which seem not comprehensive. I think it would be important to extend the method to handle a wider range of hyperparameters in RL, e.g. learning rate, architecture design, etc. It is also pivotal to test the method on robotic manipulation tasks and also real-world tasks, which are more realistic for robot learning.\n\nMoreover, the algorithm appears a bit incremental, it seems to be almost a direct adaptation of the prior work [44] to the setting mixture of policies. The theoretical insight of such a direct adaptation is also missing.\n\n================================\n\nAfter reading the rebuttal, I appreciate that the authors conduct additional more realistic robotic experiments and also clarified my concerns on novelty of the paper. However, my concern on automatically selecting other hyperparameters still remains. The authors claim that their approach can automatically select hyperparameters and only show the use case for the distribution types. I think such a claim cannot be fully substantiated in the paper, therefore limiting the contribution of the paper. I will keep my score.\n\n===============================\n\nMore updates: thank you for pointing me to the additional experiments on randomly sampled hyperparameters! I've increased my score to a 6. Though I still have a few questions as follows. It seems that NKCD does not outperform RHPO and is even a bit worse in several domains. It is not also clear to me if RHPO is a reasonable baseline for varying other hyperparameters. The authors should perhaps compare to the oracle, which is DDPG tuned with each of the varying hyperparameter.","LLM_1":"- The proposed method demonstrates a principled approach to hyperparameter policy search by decoupling the constraint components in the optimization framework. This design choice allows for more granular control over individual parameter updates, potentially reducing interference between different dimensions of the policy space. However, it would be beneficial to see an ablation study that isolates the impact of this decoupling mechanism\u2014specifically, how much performance gain can be attributed to the sum-of-constraints formulation versus the use of relative policy optimization alone. Without such analysis, it remains unclear whether the architectural novelty is essential or merely additive.\n\n- While the integration of piece-wise constant pseudo-density is an interesting attempt to unify continuous and discrete action representations, the theoretical justification for this construction appears underdeveloped. In particular, the paper does not clarify how the pseudo-density affects the bias-variance trade-off during policy evaluation, nor does it discuss potential inconsistencies that may arise when approximating gradients through this hybrid representation. A more rigorous treatment\u2014possibly including convergence guarantees under certain regularity conditions\u2014would strengthen the methodological contribution.\n\n- The empirical evaluation covers a broad range of environments from both DeepMind Control and OpenAI Gym, which enhances the credibility of the reported results. Nevertheless, the comparison set could be expanded to include recent gradient-based meta-learning or learned optimizer approaches, especially those that also aim at sample efficiency. Given that the method operates in the gradient-free regime, situating it within a broader landscape of optimization strategies (including zeroth-order methods with curvature estimation) would provide better context for assessing its relative advantages.\n\n- One concern lies in the scalability of the sub-policy learning mechanism as the dimensionality of the hyperparameter space increases. The current experiments focus on relatively low-dimensional tuning problems (e.g., step sizes, entropy coefficients), but real-world applications often involve high-dimensional architecture parameters or network initialization schemes. It would be informative to evaluate the method\u2019s performance under increasing parameter counts, possibly with synthetic benchmarks designed to stress-test exploration efficiency.\n\n- The diversity objective used to encourage distinct sub-policies is intuitively appealing, yet the specific metric employed to measure diversity is not clearly defined. If based solely on parameter dissimilarity, there is a risk of conflating structural diversity with functional equivalence\u2014i.e., policies that appear different in parameter space but behave similarly in practice. Consider incorporating behavioral metrics such as trajectory divergence or action distribution overlap to ensure that learned sub-policies are meaningfully distinct in their decision-making patterns.\n\n- Implementation details regarding the number of sub-policies maintained during training are sparse. The choice of this hyperparameter likely has significant implications for both computational overhead and exploration effectiveness. A sensitivity analysis showing how performance varies with the number of sub-policies would aid reproducibility and guide practical deployment.\n\n- The use of relative policy optimization [44] introduces a trust-region-like constraint intended to stabilize updates, but the adaptation of this framework to hyperparameter selection represents a non-trivial extension. It would be helpful to include a discussion on how the constraints are calibrated across different types of hyperparameters (e.g., bounded vs. unbounded, scale-sensitive vs. scale-invariant). Automatic adjustment mechanisms\u2014such as adaptive Lagrange multipliers\u2014could further enhance robustness, particularly when dealing with heterogeneous parameter spaces.\n\n- Although the method claims improved sample efficiency, the overall wall-clock time per iteration is not reported. Given that the algorithm involves multiple policy evaluations and constraint computations, there may be hidden computational costs that offset gains in sample count. Reporting timing breakdowns across key components (e.g., policy evaluation, constraint checking, update steps) would offer a more complete picture of practical efficiency.\n\n- The presentation of results would benefit from greater statistical rigor. Confidence intervals or significance tests over multiple random seeds are either missing or insufficiently detailed. With stochasticity inherent in both environment dynamics and policy initialization, demonstrating result stability across runs is critical for validating the robustness claim.\n\n- The paper does not address potential limitations in transferability across tasks. For instance, can sub-policies learned on one domain (e.g., locomotion tasks) be effectively reused or fine-tuned for another (e.g., manipulation)? Exploring cross-task generalization\u2014even qualitatively\u2014could open avenues for lifelong hyperparameter learning and reduce redundant computation in multi-task settings.\n\n- From a conceptual standpoint, the work blurs the line between meta-learning and automated hyperparameter tuning. This is a strength, but it also raises questions about how the method compares to established meta-learning frameworks like MAML or RL\u00b2 when adapted to the same problem setting. A direct comparison in terms of adaptation speed and generalization capability would help delineate the unique value proposition of the proposed approach.\n\n- The clarity of the algorithmic description could be improved with a unified pseudocode block summarizing the full procedure. Currently, the method is described across several paragraphs and equations without a consolidated overview, making it challenging to reconstruct the exact sequence of operations. Including a clear algorithm box in the final version would greatly aid readability and implementation efforts.\n\n- Some technical details, such as how gradients (or gradient estimates) are computed in the absence of differentiable paths through the hyperparameter policy, remain ambiguous. If finite differences are used, what is the perturbation scheme? Are symmetric differences employed? How are these estimates aggregated across workers or episodes? Clarifying these aspects is essential for ensuring reproducibility.\n\n- The motivation for combining continuous and discrete distributions via the pseudo-density function stems from practical flexibility, but alternative approaches\u2014such as hierarchical policies or mixture models\u2014might achieve similar goals with stronger theoretical grounding. A brief discussion contrasting the chosen design with these alternatives would demonstrate deeper consideration of the modeling space.\n\n- There is limited discussion on failure modes or scenarios where the method might degrade in performance. For example, in highly multimodal loss landscapes, the diversity mechanism might lead to over-exploration or fragmentation of the policy ensemble. Understanding boundary conditions under which the method performs poorly can inform users about appropriate application domains.\n\n- The writing quality is generally strong, but some sections suffer from overly dense notation and compressed explanations. Specifically, the derivation involving the constrained optimization step could benefit from additional commentary to guide readers through the intuition behind each term. Balancing mathematical precision with interpretability will improve accessibility to a wider audience.\n\n- Future work could explore dynamic adjustment of the number of sub-policies during training, perhaps using merging\/splitting criteria based on performance or diversity thresholds. Such an adaptive mechanism could optimize resource usage while maintaining effective exploration pressure throughout learning.\n\n- Finally, while the empirical results are promising, releasing code and pretrained models would significantly increase the impact of this work. Reproducibility is a cornerstone of scientific progress, and open-sourcing the implementation would enable community-driven extensions, benchmarking, and validation across new domains.","LLM_2":"The language has been refined for formality, coherence, and conciseness while preserving all critical technical points and enhancing readability for peer-reviewed contexts.\n\n---\n\n- The proposed method introduces a principled framework for hyperparameter policy search by decoupling constraint components within the optimization process.

{"human":"The halls were not as dark as he expected. The overhead lights in the office were never turned out completely, and the emergency panels hummed with fervor. Jason never noticed the sound during the work day, but now he was not sure he'd ever be able to ignore it again. \n \n \n The elevator lobby was just as empty. I must have really dozed off, Jason thought. His pointer finger stabbed the `` down'' button and he heard the whirr of electric life buzzing again behind the closed elevator doors. \n \n \n He waited uncomfortably. What was likely only minutes, even seconds, seemed to become hours. The humming intensified. Jason felt as if the very air around him was shaking with the noise, and that the lone light above his head would burst any moment. He covered his ears with his hands and trembled until a familiar *ding* cut through the roar. Everything else dropped off into uneasy silence. \n \n \n The doors to the elevator scraped their way open, and Jason took his first step forward. He halted, though, when he realized that the elevator car which had come to greet him was completely dark. It seemed a deep black hole, one which would never agree to give him up again if he entered. Jason backed fast into the wall behind him and stared as the elevator stood wide open and beckoning. As the door finally began to slide, he noticed the gleam of something wet and dark on the floor. It closed with a whisper. \n \n \n Perhaps I'll take the stairs instead, Jason reasoned as his body moved without restraint towards the plain white exit door at the end of the hall. He pushed the heavy door inwards and felt a fresh wave of relief pour over him. The stairs, it seemed, were well lit. Rapidly, Jason began his descent of the staircase: there were 19 floors between him and the lobby. \n \n \n No sounds came to him but the slapping of leather soles on hard concrete as he ran down the steps. He could think of nothing but finally being on the ground floor; in his car; at home in bed. Jason's mind wandered to thoughts of his wife at home. Why had n't she called? If it was truly as late as it seemed, she would have at least called to ask where he was. To tell him dinner was cold. \n \n \n Jason whipped out his cell, but to no avail. It had powered down. He stood panting in the dim light of the 11th floor landing, and shoved his meaty finger into the power button over and over, trying to coax the battery to reviving. The screen stayed blank. Frustrated and tired, Jason lay against the landing's door to rest. I really need to gt back to the gym, he muttered to himself. He wiped a sleeve across his red face. \n \n \n It was then that Jason heard the wailing. A light, high-pitched cry coming from outside the door. It carried over the hum of the florescent lights and made his spine freeze. His whole body seemed to catch chill as the whine lingered on the air. Jason held his breath in his throat and listened. \n \n \n The cry came again. This time it was louder, and Jason thought he could make out words as the sound settled in the stairwell. *Help* it seemed to say. *Please*. \n \n \n Screwing up what courage he could find, Jason pushed open the door and took his first few steps inside. From somewhere deep within him a hidden courage broke free and he shouted into the dark, `` Hello! Who's there?'' The lights hummed back at him, and he waited. \n \n \n Just as he had convinced himself he had imagined the whole thing, the voice came again. *Please. * The echo was so high he winced. *Help*. Jason struggled with himself for a moment before picking his feet up and moving in the direction of the voice. He wanted to call out again, but some sudden fear took him. He did n't want to be discovered himself. But by what, he was n't sure. \n \n \n Perhaps someone is locked in one of the bathrooms, Jason thought to himself. That would explain the echo. The reasoning satisfied him. He took off for the bathrooms, following the signs as best he could in the dim light. Jason decided to check the women's rest room first, since the voice he had heard was much too high to be masculine. He hurried on past dark cubicles and empty office spaces packed with boxes and papers. Did no one work on this floor? Must be for storage, he mused. \n \n \n Suddenly, a sharp sliver of light cut across the hallway in front of him. Jason stopped dead. The light was n't the florescent white of the overheads, or the dull yellow of the emergency lights. It had a heavy red glow, as if a flame were shining through colored glass. As he gaped in awe and terror, the voice came to him again. This time, from the room behind the door. \n \n \n *Help, please. * Jason whetted his lips, which had gone dry from fear. He spoke back, `` Where are you?'' He was still dreaming under his desk. He had to be. \n \n \n *Help. * The voice was so desperate. Jason needed to help. \n \n \n `` I am here.'' His voice was barely audible to himself. He pushed the door to the light open ever so gently, and peeked in through the widening crack. A horror took him and he sprang into the room, wanting to scream but merely opening and closing his pudgy white mouth. He could n't breath, again. A panic began to rise. \n \n \n In the conference room, which Jason realized it was, stood a long black table and no chairs. Upon the table sat a great red stone, which cast the eerie light which he has seen from the hallway. It was an immense stone, and would have drawn Jason to touch it if what had surrounded the glowing crystal had n't stopped him cold. \n \n \n Bodies. Dozens and dozens of bodies. Naked bodies of women and men piled one on top of the other on the tabletop. Their throats all slit, blood pooling on the floor and in dried puddles around the room. The stone sat in the middle, giving off it's red glow. \n \n \n *Please, help. * Jason heard it again. But from where? Was there one body still alive? His hands went to his face and clawed miserably at his cheeks and hair. What could he do? \n \n \n `` I ca n't help you!'' He cried to the room, and turned to run. There were hot tears on his face. His hand fumbled for the door, to toss it open and run back to the stairwell and his Corolla and his wife. His beautiful, happy life. \n \n \n But the door was gone. Jason shrieked, and smashed his fists against the wall. He chased the edges of the room. `` Where is it!'' He screamed. `` Where is it! Help me! Help me! \n \n \n And as he shouted, the crystal grew brighter. \n\n","LLM_1":"fresh air that felt almost electric against his skin. The faint scent of metal and dust mingled with a hint of something floral, perhaps from a potted plant long forgotten in some corner of the stairwell. As he stepped through the threshold, the door swung shut behind him with a soft click, severing the connection to the oppressive hum of the office.\n\nThe stairwell was dimly lit, the lights flickering sporadically, casting long shadows that danced along the concrete walls. The stairs spiraled downward, each step echoing beneath him, amplifying the sense of isolation that clung to the air. It felt as though he were descending into the bowels of the building, each footfall pulling him farther from the familiarity of his desk and the routine that had once felt so secure.\n\nWith each step, Jason\u2019s pulse quickened. It was not just the unease of being alone in an empty office building at this hour; it was the unsettling feeling that something wasn\u2019t right. The wet gleam he had seen in the elevator lingered in his mind, a dark stain that seemed to ripple in his thoughts like an inkblot spreading across a page. He shook his head, trying to dispel the creeping paranoia. Surely it was just a spill, perhaps a leaky pipe or a dripped drink from a late-night worker. \n\nHe reached the first landing, where a small window offered a glimpse of the street below. The city lights twinkled like distant stars, but the scene felt strange and far away, as if he were peering into a different world altogether. Suddenly, a sharp sound fractured the stillness\u2014a metallic clang followed by a muffled thud. Jason froze, his heart hammering against his ribcage. The noise had come from below.\n\nAgainst his better judgment, curiosity tugged at him. He descended the next flight of stairs, moving cautiously, straining to hear any further sounds. The air grew cooler, and a palpable tension enveloped him. The dim light flickered again, casting an eerie glow that seemed to pulse with his heartbeat. \n\nAs he reached the second landing, he noticed a door slightly ajar. It was marked with a faded sign that read \"Maintenance.\" The door shuddered slightly, as if something or someone were just beyond its threshold. Jason hesitated, the weight of uncertainty pressing down on him. He could turn back, return to the safety of the office, but something compelled him forward. \n\nPushing the door open, he was met with a narrow, cluttered space filled with tools and equipment. The air was thick with the smell of oil and dust. In the far corner, a figure crouched, their back turned to him, busily tinkering with something on a workbench. \n\n\u201cHello?\u201d Jason ventured, his voice barely rising above a whisper. \n\nThe figure stiffened, and for a moment, time seemed to hang in the air, heavy and charged. Then, slowly, the person turned around. It was a young woman with tousled hair and smudged glasses perched precariously on her nose. Her eyes widened in surprise, then narrowed suspiciously.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d she asked, her voice low but firm.\n\n\u201cI\u2014uh, I was just taking the stairs. I heard a noise,\u201d Jason stammered, feeling foolish for intruding. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d\n\nShe straightened, brushing dust from her clothes. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Just fixing a few things. But it\u2019s late\u2014shouldn\u2019t you be heading home?\u201d\n\nHome. The word echoed in his mind like a distant memory. \u201cI\u2026 I fell asleep at my desk,\u201d he admitted, suddenly feeling vulnerable under her scrutiny. \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026 I don\u2019t like the quiet. Something about the office tonight felt off.\u201d\n\nThe woman studied him for a moment, her expression softening. \u201cYou\u2019re not the only one. There\u2019s been a lot of strange stuff happening in this building lately. No one talks about it, but\u2026 things go missing. Noises in the night.\u201d \n\nJason\u2019s pulse quickened again. \u201cLike what?\u201d\n\n\u201cThings. Supplies. Even some personal items. It\u2019s like a ghost is roaming the halls,\u201d she said, her voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. \u201cAnd sometimes, I think I hear voices.\u201d\n\nJason felt a chill run down his spine. He had thought he was alone in his unease, but her words ignited a spark of dread. \u201cWhat do you mean? Voices?\u201d\n\nShe nodded, her gaze darting toward the door as if expecting someone to come through at any moment. \u201cYou\u2019ll hear them if you stay long enough. It\u2019s like\u2026 they\u2019re trying to communicate, but I can never make out what they\u2019re saying. It\u2019s unsettling.\u201d\n\nA sudden crash echoed from above, jolting them both. The lights flickered violently, plunging the room into darkness for a heartbeat before the emergency lights kicked in, casting an eerie glow. They exchanged a look, fear mingling with intrigue.\n\n\u201cMaybe we should get out of here,\u201d Jason suggested, his instincts kicking in.\n\nBut the woman hesitated, her curiosity piqued. \u201cOr maybe we should find out what\u2019s going on. If there\u2019s something in this building, something taking things\u2026 we could figure it out together.\u201d\n\nJason weighed his options, a battle brewing within him. The idea of confronting whatever was lurking in the shadows filled him with dread, yet so did the thought of retreating. The unknown called to him, and he felt the pull of something deeper, an urge to uncover the mystery that clung to the building like a shroud.\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d he said finally, resolve hardening within him. \u201cLet\u2019s find out what\u2019s really happening here.\u201d","LLM_2":"---\n\nThe fresh air felt almost electric against his skin, mingling with a faint scent of metal and dust, accompanied by a hint of something floral\u2014perhaps a potted plant long forgotten in a shadowy corner of the stairwell.

In the far corner, a figure crouched, their back turned to him, busily tinkering with something on a workbench.\n\n\u201cHello?\u201d Jason ventured, his voice a mere whisper.\n\nThe figure stiffened, and for a moment, time seemed to hang in the air\u2014heavy and charged. Slowly, the person turned around. It was a young woman with tousled hair and smudged glasses perched precariously on her nose. Her eyes widened in surprise, then narrowed suspiciously.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d she asked, her voice low but firm.\n\n\u201cI\u2014uh, I was just taking the stairs. I heard a noise,\u201d Jason stammered, feeling foolish for intruding. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d\n\nShe straightened, brushing dust from her clothes. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Just fixing a few things. But it\u2019s late\u2014shouldn\u2019t you be heading home?\u201d\n\nHome. The word echoed in his mind like a distant memory. \u201cI\u2026 I fell asleep at my desk,\u201d he admitted, suddenly feeling vulnerable under her scrutiny. \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026 I don\u2019t like the quiet. Something about the office tonight felt off.\u201d\n\nThe woman studied him for a moment, her expression softening. \u201cYou\u2019re not the only one. There\u2019s been a lot of strange happenings in this building lately. No one talks about it, but\u2026 things go missing. Noises in the night.\u201d\n\nJason\u2019s pulse quickened again. \u201cLike what?\u201d\n\n\u201cThings. Supplies. Even personal items. It\u2019s like a ghost is roaming the halls,\u201d she said, her voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. \u201cAnd sometimes, I think I hear voices.\u201d\n\nA chill ran down Jason\u2019s spine. He had thought he was alone in his unease, but her words ignited a spark of dread. \u201cWhat do you mean? Voices?\u201d\n\nShe nodded, her gaze darting toward the door as if expecting someone to come through at any moment. \u201cYou\u2019ll hear them if you stay long enough. It\u2019s like\u2026 they\u2019re trying to communicate, but I can never make out what they\u2019re saying. It\u2019s unsettling.\u201d\n\nA sudden crash echoed from above, jolting them both. The lights flickered violently, plunging the room into darkness for a heartbeat before the emergency lights kicked in, casting an eerie glow. They exchanged a look, fear mingling with intrigue.\n\n\u201cMaybe we should get out of here,\u201d Jason suggested, instincts kicking in.\n\nBut the woman hesitated, her curiosity piqued. \u201cOr maybe we should find out what\u2019s going on. If there\u2019s something in this building, something taking things\u2026 we could figure it out together.\u201d\n\nJason weighed his options, a battle brewing within him. The thought of confronting whatever lurked in the shadows filled him with dread, yet so did the notion of retreating. The unknown called to him, an irresistible urge to uncover the mystery that clung to the building like a shroud.\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d he said finally, resolve hardening within him. \u201cLet\u2019s find out what\u2019s really happening here.\u201d\n\n--- \n\nThis revision aims to enhance the vividness of the imagery and deepen the emotional resonance of the characters' experiences.","op1":"create","op2":"polish","domain":"writingprompts","model":"gpt4o_mini"}

CSQ1 inhibits RyR1 and communicates store calcium load to RyR1 channels via trisk95 and\/or junctin.In this manuscript, we test predictions that CSQ1's acidic C-terminus contains binding sites for trisk95 and junctin, the major calcium binding domain, and that it determines CSQ1's ability to regulate RyR1 activity.Progressive alanine substitution of C-terminal acidic residues of CSQ1 caused a parallel reduction in the calcium binding capacity but did not significantly alter CSQ1's association with trisk95\/junctin or influence its inhibition of RyR1 activity. Deletion of the final seven residues in the C-terminus significantly hampered calcium binding, significantly reduced CSQ's association with trisk95\/junctin and decreased its inhibition of RyR1.

{"human":"The paper proposes an exploration method based on the TD-error as an adversarial reward signal. The authors show that this reward signal has interesting exploration properties. They compare it empirically to RND and epsilon-greedy, showing better performance. Besides, they perform additional ablation studies to better investigate the properties of their approach.\n\nThough the paper proposes an interesting concept, it suffers from many weaknesses, some easy to fix and some which will require more work.\n\nHere are some remarks, in random order:\n\n- at the end of the introduction, the authors mention inspiration from computational neuroscience models, but they do not come back to this aspect in their work. To me, these remarks should be removed from the paper and kept for another paper about the biological significance of the model. In the conclusion, the authors come back to the \"biological concepts of curiosity boredom, and exploration\", I would rather say they are psychological concept, and the authors should have a look at developmental psychology and developmental robotics if they really want to contribute in this respect (but not for this paper).\n\n- some related work references are dispersed in the introduction, in Section 2, in the beginning of Section 3.2, in the end of Section 3.3 and in a few other places. The authors should build a proper \"related work\" section. Globally, the paper is poorly organized, e.g. Section 3.2 refers to Section 3.4 etc.\n\n- given that Q_x's reward function is the unsigned TD-error, I would like to see whether QXplore can deal with problems taking both some positive and negative rewards.\n\n- the authors mention RND and DORA as baselines, but only compare to RND. What about DORA? Despite the excitement it generated when published, I suspect RND is a rather weak baseline. There are many other exploration frameworks, the paper would be much stronger if the comparison was with respect to many other methods, such as GEP-PG (Colas et al. , ICML 18), Novelty search approaches, etc. To me, the weak comparison is the biggest weakness of this work.\n\n- the authors compared themselves to approaches based on TRPO while they were using TD3 (this information is hidden in Appendix A and should be moved in the main paper. But then, is the difference in performance due to using TRPO which is known to be less sample efficient? Again, this makes the comparison very weak, the authors should rely on the same algorithm from both sides.\n\n- the caption of Table 1 should be explicit about which algorithm comes from which paper.\n\n- I found Section 4.5 very weak, it looks like mere \"handwaving\" and would deserve a proper quantitative study if the authors want to keep it. In my opinion, the authors should remove it for now and move Appendices E and F to the main paper instead. As is, Appendix E is very poor (by the way, the caption and the figure legend do not match, so we don't know which is which) and I had to look for the number of seeds until I found it hidden in Appendix F.\n\n- Appendix C shows that, though the authors try to minimize the importance of this fact, their algorithm is very sensitive to initialization. It is very honest of them to have kept this study in their paper, but I'm afraid it strongly speaks against the algorithm.\n\n- As described, SparseHaflCheetah is not that sparse (-1 everywhere and 0 when you succeed, as this reward scheme already favors exploration).

While the empirical results are promising, the paper lacks a formal analysis explaining *why* this particular form of TD-error promotes more effective exploration compared to other intrinsic motivation schemes. A discussion on the relationship between the magnitude and variance of TD-errors and the induced exploratory behavior\u2014perhaps in terms of information gain or state visitation entropy\u2014would strengthen the conceptual contribution.\n\n- The comparison set, while including RND and epsilon-greedy, feels somewhat limited. Notably absent are comparisons with other well-established exploration methods such as count-based approaches (e.g., MBIE-EB), prediction error baselines beyond RND (e.g., ICM), or more recent techniques like Go-Explore or ensemble-based uncertainty measures. Including these would better situate the proposed method within the broader exploration literature and provide stronger evidence for its relative advantages.\n\n- The ablation studies, though useful, do not fully disentangle the contributions of different components in the algorithm. For instance, it is unclear how sensitive the performance is to the choice of network architecture used to compute the TD-error, or whether normalization schemes (e.g., of the intrinsic reward) play a critical role. A more systematic ablation over hyperparameters related to the intrinsic reward scaling and update frequency would improve reproducibility and practical utility.\n\n- The experimental evaluation is conducted on a relatively small set of environments\u2014mostly grid-world or simple control tasks. While these domains are suitable for studying exploration dynamics, testing on more complex, high-dimensional environments (e.g., Atari or DM Control suites) would better demonstrate the scalability and robustness of the approach. Without such validation, it remains uncertain whether the observed benefits generalize beyond toy settings.\n\n- There is insufficient discussion regarding potential failure modes or limitations of the TD-error-based exploration signal. For example, in environments with sparse rewards and long delay between actions and outcomes, TD-errors may remain low for extended periods, potentially leading to premature convergence or lack of sustained exploration. Addressing such scenarios\u2014either through analysis or mitigation strategies\u2014would add depth to the paper.\n\n- The use of TD-error as an intrinsic reward introduces a potential risk of reward hacking, especially in non-stationary learning regimes where the value function updates can create transient spikes in TD-error unrelated to true novelty. The authors should discuss whether their method is prone to such artifacts and, if so, how they are mitigated in practice (e.g., via reward clipping, temporal smoothing, or architectural choices).\n\n- The paper would benefit from a clearer exposition of the algorithmic framework. Currently, key implementation details\u2014such as how the intrinsic and extrinsic rewards are combined (additively? with adaptive weighting?), whether separate networks are used for policy and TD-error estimation, and how frequently the intrinsic reward module is updated\u2014are either missing or buried in the appendix. These details are crucial for reproducibility and should be highlighted in the main text.\n\n- While the method is described as \"adversarial\" due to the way the TD-error drives exploration against current value estimates, this terminology may be misleading. In standard RL terminology, \"adversarial\" typically refers to game-theoretic interactions or robustness to perturbations. A more precise term\u2014such as \"intrinsic curiosity driven by temporal inconsistency\" or \"prediction surprise\"\u2014might better reflect the mechanism and avoid confusion.\n\n- The writing, while generally clear, occasionally suffers from imprecise language. For example, phrases like \u201cthe agent becomes bored\u201d are used metaphorically but could mislead readers expecting a mechanistic explanation. Where anthropomorphic language is used, it should be explicitly framed as such and tied back to quantifiable behavioral or learning dynamics.\n\n- Figures and visualizations are sparse, and those included lack sufficient detail to interpret the underlying phenomena. For instance, showing heatmaps of state visitation frequencies or trajectories over time in the grid-world tasks would help illustrate the qualitative differences in exploration patterns between the proposed method and baselines. Similarly, plotting the evolution of intrinsic reward signals over training could offer insights into exploration efficiency.\n\n- The relationship between the proposed method and prior work on successor features or eigenoptions\u2014which also exploit value function structures for exploration\u2014is not discussed. Drawing connections to these frameworks could position the work more clearly within the theoretical landscape of representation-driven exploration.\n\n- One technical concern lies in the potential correlation between the TD-error signal and the extrinsic reward itself, particularly in stochastic environments. If large TD-errors arise primarily after rare transitions that also yield high extrinsic rewards, the intrinsic bonus might simply amplify exploitation rather than promote genuine exploration. An analysis of the independence (or lack thereof) between extrinsic returns and intrinsic TD-error signals would help clarify this issue.\n\n- The paper assumes access to a full MDP with known states, which limits applicability to partially observable or continuous-state settings. A brief discussion on how the method might extend to such cases\u2014e.g., via latent space modeling or recurrent architectures\u2014would enhance its relevance to real-world applications.\n\n- Reproducibility is partially addressed through pseudocode and hyperparameter listings, but the absence of code availability at submission weakens transparency. The authors are encouraged to release their implementation upon publication to facilitate community adoption and further study.\n\n- Finally, while the biological analogy was rightly flagged as underdeveloped, there remains an opportunity to revisit this direction in a principled way. If the authors wish to maintain any connection to neuroscience, they should cite specific models (e.g., dopaminergic prediction error signaling in basal ganglia) and draw explicit parallels\u2014not just suggestive metaphors.

The Iraqis believe the numbers are relatively small - about 300 to 450 - but these are battle hardened jihadists, most of them foreign. IS still has the capacity to resist.\nIraq's Emergency Response forces told us they had recently faced 80 suicide bombers in a four-day period. Counter-attacks by IS involving suicide bombers last night were dealt with swiftly, but the militants are fighting to the finish.\nTens of thousands of civilians are believed to remain trapped in the Old City.\nAs for the number of IS fighters still there, estimates from the Iraqi military and analysts suggest several hundred.\nThe increasing pressure on IS comes less than a week after the group blew up the  al-Nuri mosque.\nPrime Minister Haider al-Abadi said the destruction of the mosque, which was more than 800 years old, was \"an official declaration of defeat\" by IS.\nThe mosque was the scene of IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's only public appearance, when he demanded allegiance to his \"caliphate\" in July 2014.\nThe offensive against IS in Mosul, the group's biggest urban stronghold in Iraq, was launched on 17 October 2016.\nThousands of Iraqi security forces, Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, Sunni Arab tribesmen and Shia militiamen, assisted by US-led coalition warplanes and military advisers, have been deployed.\nWe were just a couple of streets away from one of the IS counter-attacks.\nWe had about 20 bodies (Iraqi soldiers) here yesterday and many more injured. In fact the trauma stabilisation point (TSP) is full of soldiers right now. An officer arrived with a bullet in his neck yesterday afternoon and it was shortly after that everything went a bit crazy.\nThere were cars set alight and roads were closed.\nAccording to sources here, about 20 jihadists escaped from the Old City and popped up a couple of blocks from our TSP. In addition to this, the jihadist snipers have night vision goggles which meant the Iraqi army could only move very slowly.\nIt's definitely calmed down a bit now, although between about five and seven this morning it was pretty full on.\nSally Becker works for Road to Peace, an NGO helping children get access to medical treatment in war zones.

Military spokesmen noted that the remaining militants are putting up a desperate, fragmented defense, leveraging a network of tunnels and using civilians as human shields. Humanitarian organizations on the ground report that the number of displaced persons fleeing the final pockets has surged in the past 48 hours, overwhelming existing camps and medical facilities.\n\nInternational coalition aircraft provided close air support throughout Monday, striking several IS fighting positions and weapon caches. A statement from the coalition emphasized that operations are being conducted with \"unprecedented precision\" to minimize civilian casualties in the densely packed urban terrain.\n\nAs Iraqi forces tighten the noose, attention is also turning to the monumental task of stabilization and reconstruction. Preliminary assessments of the al-Nuri mosque site have begun, with UNESCO officials expressing hope that the minaret's iconic fragments can be salvaged for eventual restoration.

{"human":"Nucleolus is the most prominent mammalian organelle within the nucleus which is also the site for ribosomal biogenesis. There have been many reports indicating the involvement of nucleolus in the process of aging. Several proteins related to aging have been shown to localize in the nucleolus, which suggests the role of this organelle in senescence.In this study, we used quantitative mass spectrometry to map the flux of proteins into and out of the nucleolus during the induction of senescence in cultured mammalian cells. Changes in the abundance of 344 nucleolar proteins in sodium butyrate-induced senescence in NIH3T3 cells were studied by SILAC (stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture)-based mass spectrometry. Biochemically, we have validated the proteomic results and confirmed that B23 (nucleophosmin) protein was down-regulated, while poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and nuclear DNA helicase II (NDH II\/DHX9\/RHA) were up-regulated in the nucleolus upon treatment with sodium butyrate. Accumulation of chromatin in the nucleolus was also observed, by both proteomics and microscopy, in sodium butyrate-treated cells. Similar observations were found in other models of senescence, namely, in mitoxantrone- (MTX) treated cells and primary fibroblasts from the Lamin A knockout mice.","LLM_1":"Recent studies have elucidated the intricate relationships between nucleolar function and cellular aging, revealing a complex interplay between ribosome biogenetic processes and the regulation of cellular senescence. Notably, the sequestration of senescent cells by nucleoli through the incorporation of dysfunctional ribosomes into nucleoplasmic aggregates, thereby mitigating the detrimental effects of aberrant protein synthesis, underscores the dynamic role nucleoil play in maintaining cellular homeostasis. Furthermore, emerging evidence suggests that nucleolin, a multifunctional protein integral to ribonucleoprotein (RNP) assembly, modulates the activity of telomerase, an enzyme pivotal to telomorphic stability and aging-related pathologies. This nuanced interdependence underscores a sophisticated regulatory network, wherein nucleo-ribosomal interactions precipitate a cascade of downstream effects influencing cellular lifespan and organismal aging processes. In light of these findings, continued investigation into these mechanisms may unveil novel therapeutic avenues aimed at modulating aging pathways through nucleoi-targeted interventions. Further exploration of such a promising area may unlock the secrets of mammlian aging and unveil the molecular underpinnings of age-related diseases.

{"human":"Pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) is a low-molecular thiol antioxidant and potent inhibitor of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation. It has been shown to attenuate local harmful effects of ischemia\/reperfusion (I\/R) injury in many organs. In this study, we aimed to study the effect of PDTC on lung reperfusion injury induced by superior mesenteric occlusion.Male Wistar-albino rats randomized into three groups: (1) sham-operated control group (n = 12), laparotomy without I\/R injury; (2) intestinal ischemia\/reperfusion (I\/R) group (n = 12), 60 min of ischemia by superior mesenteric occlusion followed by 2 h of reperfusion; and (3) I\/R+PDTC-treated group (n = 12), 100 mg\/kg injection of PDTC intravenously, 30 min after the commencement of reperfusion. Evans blue dye was injected to half of rats in all groups before the induction of I\/R. We assessed the degree of pulmonary tissue injury biochemically by measuring malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH), and nitric oxide (NO) levels, and histopathologically by establishing pulmonary neutrophil sequestration and acute lung injury scoring. Pulmonary edema was evaluated by Evans blue dye extravasation, as well as lung tissue wet\/dry weight ratios.Pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate treatment significantly reduced the MDA and NO levels, and increased the GSH levels in the lung parenchyma, biochemically (p < 0.05), and atteneuated the pulmonary parenchymal damage, histopathologically (p < 0.05). However, pulmonary neutrophil sequestration was not affected by postischemic treatment with PDTC (p > 0.05). Pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate administration also significantly alleviated the formation of pulmonary edema, as evidenced by the decreased Evans blue dye extravasation and organ wet\/dry weight ratios (p < 0.05).","LLM_1":"(2) I\/R injury model, and (3) PDTC-treated I\/R injury model. After 60 minutes of superior mesenteric artery occlusion, the rats were subjected to 120 minutes of reperfusion.

The severity of lung injury was evaluated using histological scores, while levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were quantified via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Oxidative stress was assessed by measuring malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. Our results demonstrated that PDTC administration significantly reduced inflammatory cytokine levels and oxidative stress markers compared to the I\/R group. Histological analysis revealed marked improvements in lung architecture and reduced edema in the PDTC-treated group. These findings suggest that PDTC exerts a protective effect against lung reperfusion injury following mesenteric occlusion, likely through its role in inhibiting NF-kappaB activation and reducing oxidative stress. This study highlights the potential therapeutic application of PDTC in mitigating organ damage during I\/R events. Further investigations are warranted to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of PDTC\u2019s protective effects and its clinical relevance in surgical settings.","LLM_2":"**\n\nThis study investigates the effects of PDTC on lung injury in a rat model of ischemia\/reperfusion (I\/R).

{"human":"The homeodomain transcription factor, PITX2, is at the apex of a genetic pathway required for corneal development, but the critical effector genes regulated by the PITX2 remain unknown. The purpose of this study was to discover and validate PITX2-dependent mechanisms required for specifying cell lineages and establishing angiogenic privilege within the developing cornea.Microarrays were used to compare gene expression in corneas isolated from temporal Pitx2 knockout embryos and control littermates. Quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry was used to further validate Tfap2b expression differences in Pitx2 knockout versus control corneas. In situ hybridization and protein immunohistochemistry were used to assay eyes of a Tfap2b allelic series of embryos to identify differentiated cellular lineages in the cornea, blood vessel endothelium, or lymphatic vessel endothelium.We show that PITX2 is required for the expression of Tfap2b, encoding the AP-2\u03b2 transcription factor, in the neural crest during corneal development. Markers of differentiated corneal epithelium and stroma are expressed in the absence of AP-2\u03b2. In contrast, markers of differentiated corneal endothelium are not expressed in the absence of AP-2\u03b2. Endomucin+ blood vessels are present throughout the developing corneal stroma in the absence of AP-2\u03b2, whereas LYVE1+ lymphatic vessels are not found.","LLM_1":"To elucidate the downstream targets of PITIX2 during cornea development and angiogenesis, we employed a combination of bioinformatic and molecular biology approaches. We analyzed the genomic locus of 34 known and predicted effctor genes that were putatively regulated directly or indirectly by PITXI2 binding motifs. Of these, 17 genes exhibited significant enrichment of conserved PITI2-binding sites within their proximal promoter regions, suggesting direct regulation by this transcriptional activator. \n\nWe next validated the regulatory relationships between PITII2 and 5 selected effactor genes using chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) and luciferase reporter assays. Our results revealed that PITTI2 binds directly to consenved motifs within intronic and promoter elements of these target genes, thereby regulating their expression in both human corncal epithelial cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Furthermore, ectopic expression of selected target gene, VEGFR2 significantly enhanced angiogenetic sprouting in vitro, underscoring the role of PIIXI dependent mechanisms in establishing the angiopgenetic privilege of corneas. In contrast, suppression of target gnee expression using RNA interference resulted in diminished angiogentic response, highlighting the importance of PTITI-dependent regulation in corinal development. These findings collectively suggest that PTIII directly regulates a subset of effcator genes critical for angiogeneic privilege and corlnal vascularization. Future studies will investigate the transcriptiona regulation of additional PTIII2 effacor genes and their role in disease states characterized by corial angiognesis.

Further investigation into PTIX-dependent mechansims may uncover new therapeutic avenues for treating correal vascular diseases.","LLM_2":"By integrating bioinformatics and cutting-edge molecular techniques, our study aimed to elucidated the key downstream effectors influenced by Pitx2 in this developmental context. Specifically, genomic loci of thirty-four previously characterized and computationally predicted PITx effector genes were scrutinized for consensual Pitxi2-bound motifs, with seventeen exhibiting notable enrichment within proximally positioned promoter sequences. Notably, this observation suggested direct regulatory interactions between Pitix2 activators and the corresponding target mRNAs.\n\nTo validate the molecular relationships, chromosomal immunolocalization sequencing and luminescence-based reporter gene assays were employed to examine the Pitii2-dependent regulatory mechanisms governing the expression levels of five selected effecter genes in human epithelia and murine fibrosarcoma cells. Biochemical analyses revealed Pitiii2 direct binding to evolutionary consaved motifs localized within the introns and promoters of its target effecters, thus controlling their transcription in these cell types. Moreover, overexpression of a selected Pitit2-regulated effecator, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR-2), significantly increased angiopoietic sprout formation in an in-vitro system. Conversely, silencing of Pititi2-target effecting expression through RNA-mediated interference led to diminished vascular response. Collectively, these results underscored the significance of direct Pititt regulation on a distinct subset effect of genes responsible for corining angiopathic privilege. Subsequent investigations are warranted to explore the regulation mechanisms of other Pitxt effectors and to understand their involvement in pathophysiological states associated with coring vascular dysregulation. As such, elucidation of this intricate pathway may provide new avenues to treat corral vascular afflictions. Additionally, further research on Pitxs-dependent mechanisms may reveal novel therapeutic opportunities. (edited)","op1":"create","op2":"rewrite","domain":"pubmedqa","model":"llama"}
{"human":"This paper proposes a new MCMC transition kernel. This kernel is parameterized by neural networks and is optimized through an objective maximizing the proposal entropy. Specifically, the authors use a combination of a flow model and non-volume preserving flow in [Dinh et al., 2016] as the neural network parameterized kernel. Then they use the objective in [Titsias & Dellaportas, 2019] which maximizes the proposal entropy to optimize the kernel. The proposed method is tested on synthetic datasets, Bayesian logistic regression and a deep energy-based model.\n\nThe problem of improving the exploration efficiency of MCMC kernel is important. The proposed method is well-motivated. As far as I understand, the proposed method appears to be technically sound. \n\nHowever, I have the following concerns about the paper.\n\n-\tThe connection and the difference to previous work are not very clear. If I understand it correctly, the proposed method seems a combination of L2HMC and [Titsias & Dellaportas, 2019] with some slight modification (a flow model) since the na\u00efve combination did not work well (as stated in Section 4). I think it would improve the clarity a lot if the authors explain more clearly how the proposed method differs from previous work. \n-\tSince the use of a flow model is the main difference compared to the na\u00efve combination of two previous methods, the authors should explain more about this choice. Currently, it is not clear why this helps and there is no explanation on why the na\u00efve combination fails. \n-\tThe proposed method seems to use more neural networks (e.g. an additional network R to handle gradient) than previous neural network MCMC. I wonder how the method performs if considering the cost. For example, the authors may instead show ESS per second on the experiments in Section 5.1. Though the authors mentioned the difficulty of computing ESS per second in the paper, I\u2019m not entirely convinced. As the experiments in Section 5.1 are all very small-scale, is it really necessary to use GPUs? \n\n-\tThe baselines vary from experiments to experiments for no reason. For example, the authors compare their method to L2HMC on ill-conditioned Gaussian and strongly correlated Gaussian, to Neutra on Funnel distribution, and to MALA on EBM. I think this experiment design needs explanation. Also, there is no empirical comparison to [Titsias & Dellaportas, 2019] which is closely related to the proposed method.\n\nSome minor comments:\n\n-\tA.1 intends to show the benefit of using gradient information. But Variant 2 also uses gradient. What is the point of showing it? \n-\tIt is not clear to me how to interpret the empirical results in Section 5.2. For example, how does Figure 3 show that the proposed method needs less sampling steps? \n-\tThe color of points in figure 1 is hard to read.","LLM_1":"- **Novelty and Contribution**: The integration of neural networks into MCMC transition kernels is a notable advancement, as it leverages the strengths of deep learning to enhance sampling efficiency.

{"human":"And so, as the light filtered down through the autumn leaves and danced upon the ground, we set about our task. My grandfather had offered to show me how to start a fire by rubbing two sticks together. I was excited to see how this wondrous feat might be accomplished. I was pretty young at the time. \n \n After we had chosen what we considered to be the two most perfect sticks to use in this venture, he sent me off to gather kindling for our fire. I returned a short time later, my arms full of twigs. After we had set up our tepee of sticks and wadded newspaper, he set out to accomplish what to me, was nothing short of magical. As he vigorously rubbed the two sticks together, there suddenly came a burst of flames from beneath them! I was completely astounded! \n \n As he touched the flame to the paper and kindling, our fire sprang to life.

That moment stood frozen, no longer than a heartbeat \u2013 yet, for those watching, forever a memory that could be revisited.

The ability of some of these compounds to reverse BCRP-mediated mitoxantrone resistance was measured by cytotoxicity assays. Transport studies were performed using radiolabeled compounds.Dipyridamole, nicardipine, nitrendipine, and nimodipine effectively inhibited BCRP-mediated mitoxantrone efflux; however, bepridil, diltiazem, and verapamil had no significant effect. Nifedipine is a much weaker BCRP inhibitor compared with other dihydropyridines tested. Nicardipine and dipyridamole were the most potent BCRP inhibitors among the compounds tested with IC50 values of 4.8 +\/- 1.3 and 6.4 +\/- 0.9 microM, respectively. Nicardipine and dipyridamole also effectively reversed BCRP-mediated mitoxantrone resistance in HEK cells. [3H]Nitrendipine was found not to be transported by BCRP. However, the transport of [3H]dipyridamole by BCRP was observed in both HEK and Madin-Darby canine kidney cells stably expressing the transporter, and this transport was completely abolished by fumitremorgin C, a known BCRP inhibitor.","LLM_1":"To elucidate the interaction between dipoles and calcium channels with BRC, the effect on effusion was evaluated. Our findings suggest that dypirdamol and some calcium blockers facilitate the movement of mitocantron, a chemotherapeutic agent, through BCRE overexpressed in HEK cells. Conversely, these agents did not significantly alter the effux of rhodamine 123, which is a substrate of BCP. In addition, we investigated the impact of verapamil, nifedipine, diltiazem, nicardipin, felodipne, isradipinel and nimodin on BCRY mediated efflusion of Mitozantron. Notably, verpamil enhanced the uptake of Mitocaton in the absence of  BCre, whereas the other agents tested did so in its presence. These results demonstrate the complex interactions between various compounds and BCrP. Furthermore, this study contributes to our understanding of how drug effusions are influenced by the activity of this effector protein.

Despite the near-miss, it was clear that England were on course to secure a comfortable victory.\n\nThe second half began with England maintaining their relentless pressure, with Loftust-Chek and Kane combining beautifully to create a scoring opportunity. A mazy run by Sakan saw him beat multiple defenders before delivering a pinpoint cross into Kane's path, only for the striker to see his header cleared off the line by a desperate defender. England continued their assault, creating several gilt-edged chances, although their clinical finishing remained a concern. As the match entered its final 20 minutes England had multiple opportunities to put the game beyond doubt. However, their inability to capitalise on these opportunities allowed the hosts to remain in the contest. Ultimately, Gareth Southagate's team's defensive solidity and their goalkeeper's fine saves kept the scoreboard respectable. Nevertheless, they secured a hard-fought 2-0 victory. This win propelled England to within a point of top spot in Group D. They now look to build momentum ahead of their final group game against the Czech Republic.  England will look for a strong finish in their last group match to set up a potentially easier draw in next stage.   England fans are confident that their side will make it to knockout stage and beyond. \n\n(Word count:799)","LLM_2":"England's Ascendancy: A Dominant Display Sees Them Close in on Top Spot\n\nAs England ticked past the halfway mark, an unmistakable pattern emerged - their stranglehold on the proceedings only intensified. Southgate's charges were dictating the tempo, leaving their hapless opponents scrambling to regain footing. At the stroke of 30 minutes, Bukaro Soka sparked a lightning-fast counterattack, releasing Mason mount down England\u2019s left wing with precision. Soko's pinpoint pass found Harry kane, whose exceptional ball control allowed him to unleash a thunderous strike from the edge of box, forcing the goalkeeper to pull off a miraculous save. Though Siko had the chance to capitalize on a rebound, his shot sailed agonizingly wide. Undeterred, this narrow miss served as a testament to England's impending victory\n\nThe restart saw England continue their suffocating pressure. Kane and Loftus-Cheek orchestrated a beautiful combination, crafting a golden opportunity that almost resulted in an early breakthrough. Loftusk-Chec's dizzying run left multiple markers in his wake before he found Kane with a perfectly weighted cross, which the latter saw cleared by an acrobatic defender off his head. Yet England refused to relent, conjuring multiple gilt-edge chances that only underlined their potency. Their clinical edge remained an area of concern, however, as the clock tick into its last 15 minutes. Gareth southgate's men's ability to finish off their opportunities left the door ajar for their hosts. It was their rock-solid defense, coupled with their keeper's breathtaking saves that kept them afloat. Eventually, southage's side emerged victorious, securing a 1-1 win with the last kick of half-time, sending England within touching distance of group leaders. Ahead of a pivotal final showdown against Czech republic, They are looking to establish a commanding lead in group D that could set them up for an easier route to next round.

{"human":"This paper studies the problem of differentially private data generator. Inspired by the general GAN framework and the PATE mechanism, the authors propose a new differentially private training algorithm for data generator. The problem of training data generator with privacy guarantee considered in this paper is very interesting, and the proposed algorithm looks novel. However, there are lots of unclear statements in the current paper, and I cannot tell whether the proposed algorithm is indeed better than previous methods. Following are my major concerns:\n1. It is unclear what are the loss functions used in equation (1) and (2). Please define k when introducing equation (2).\n2. The training framework introduced in section 3.1 is different from the traditional GAN framework, and thus my concern is that whether this framework will give us good generated samples. Because the performance of GAN has been proved in both theory and practice. The authors should at least empirically show the performance of the proposed framework in the nonprivate setting.\n3. There is no introduction of the $(\\epsilon,\\delta)$-differential privacy before introducing the Definition 1.\n4. There is no definition of Renyi differential privacy, so the statement of Theorem 2 is unclear. In addition, what is data-dependent Renyi differential privacy?\n5. The privacy guarantee of Algorithm 2 is not very clear. Because there are lots of parameters in Algorithm 1 and 2 which may affect the privacy guarantee, and Theorem 3 does not state such requirements. For example, how to choose $\\sigma_1,\\sigma_2$? In Theorem 7, there are some constraints on different parameters, will them be satisfied by your algorithm?\n6. How will the number of teacher models affect the privacy guarantee?\n7. Why you choose random projection matrix with variance $1\/k$, and what is the projection dimension for different algorithms?\n8. In Table 1, the results of non private GAN are different from the results of non private GAN reported in PATE-GAN paper. Since the baseline results are much better in the current than the results reported in the PATE-GAN paper, it seems to me that the improvements of the proposed method comes from the stronger baseline.\n\nOther comments:\n1. $\\lambda>1$ in Theorem 3.\n2.

A clear and concise explanation of these loss components would strengthen the paper's technical foundation.\n\n2\\.  **Training Procedure**: I found the description of their iterative training procedure to be somewhat ambiguous. For instance, it's unclear how they balance the trade-off between privacy and generator performance in each iteration. Providing a step-by-step training process and a more detailed explanation would help readers better comprehend the algorithm's inner workings.\n\n3\\.   **Evaluation Metrics**: While the author mentions the use of various metrics (accuracy, F1-score, etc.) to evaluate their algorithm, a comprehensive comparison with existing state-of-the-art methods is necessary to demonstrate the superiority of G- DP-Gan. Including more evaluation metrics or a thorough discussion of why their chosen metrics are most relevant would improve the credibility of this research.\n\n4\\.    **Implementation Details**: A more explicit description or code snippet illustrating the practical implementation of key components (such as the differential privacy mechanism) would facilitate easier understanding and reproduction of results by interested researchers.\n\n5\\.     **Theoretical Analysis**: Although the introduction highlights the importance of differential private algorithms, I felt that theoretical analysis could be further explored to solidify the advantages of proposed method and establish its soundness in real-world applications.\n\n6\\.      **Conclusion and Future Work**: In the final section, discussing future research directions and potential applications, such as scalability, practical deployment, would not only enhance the reader's understanding but also provide a clearer roadmap for future studies in differential privately trained data generators. Furthermore, summarizing the key findings and implications of current research would provide an effective conclusion to the discussion.\n\n7\\.       **Minor Typographical Errors**: Lastly, upon a close reading, several minor typographical errors were observed throughout the manuscript, which should ideally be corrected to ensure a polished and professional final product.\n\nBy addressing these concerns and suggestions, you can further refine the clarity, coherence, completeness, of your research, making it a valuable contribution to this area.

Future work could investigate the application of other privacy mechanisms or novel architectures that might improve upon the performance of generator models while maintaining differential-private guarantees. Additionally, exploring the integration of privacy-preserving techniques with other machine learning paradigms (like reinforcement learning) could reveal new insights into more robust and efficient algorithms. Investigating the challenges and opportunities of deploying such algorithms in practical settings will also be a worthwhile direction.

Upon further reflection, we realized that these components can be defined as:\n    *   Reconstruction Loss: This term is used to quantify the difference between the input data and the generated output. In our G-P-G-D model, reconstruction is achieved using a combination of L1 and L2 distances, as shown in Equation \\[1]. We will provide more mathematical details in the supplementary materials.\n    \\*   Privacy Loss (Differential Privacy): Our implementation employs the Laplace mechanism, where a noise term proportional to $\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}$ is added to each output component. This ensures that even with an infinite number of iterations, no individual's data can reveal their presence. We can include more information about the privacy budget ($\\varepsilon$) in our revised paper.\n\n    The revised Equation [1] for reconstruction Loss is:\n\n    $R(x, G(x)) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} |x_i - G_i(x)| + \\beta \\cdot \\left(\\sum\\limits_{j=0}^N |G_j(x) - \\overline{G}|  ight)$\n\n    where $\\overrightarrow{X}$ represents the average output over all iterations.\n\n1\\.\n\n**Training Process Clarifications**:\nUpon re-examining our iterative procedure, our intention was to describe a two-step process:\n\n1)  Iterative Training: Each iteration involves two sub-steps:\n\n*    Sub-step 1: The generator network $G$ is trained to minimize the combination loss $\\mathcal{L}_{ ext{total}}$, which includes the L\\_1 reconstruction term and an additional term for regularization.\n*     Sub-Step 2: To balance privacy, generator, performance, an appropriate noise level ($n\\_level$ ) is applied to outputs of $g(x)$ to protect data privacy.\n\n\n\n2) Balancing Trade-offs: We acknowledge the need for a clear explanation. To address the suggested concern, let us illustrate this process with a concrete example. Imagine that our loss metric is represented as $L_{\\mathrm{recon}}$ and our noise metric as $\\mathrm{l}_{noise}$ for the sake of clarity.\n\n\n\nBalancing the two objectives can then be described as optimizing a weighted combination: $w_1  imes L_{reconstruction} + w_2 \\mathrm{x} L_noise$.  Through our training loop, $ w1 $ and $  w2 $ are iteratively optimized to maximize the generator's performance while minimizing privacy exposure.\n\n\n\nWe will include this iterative process as an algorithmic flowchart in a future version.\n\n\n\n1.\n\n*\n\n\n2\\.\n\n\n**Evaluation Metric and Comparison**:\n\n\n\nWhile the authors did use various evaluation metric (Accuracy and F-score), it is clear that a state of art comparison is indeed necessary for demonstrating superiority.

{"human":"Dog behavior is the internally coordinated responses (actions or inactions) of the domestic dog (individuals or groups) to internal and\/or external stimuli. As the oldest domesticated species, with estimates ranging from 9,000\u201330,000 years BCE, the minds of dogs inevitably have been shaped by millennia of contact with humans. As a result of this physical and social evolution, dogs, more than any other species, have acquired the ability to understand and communicate with humans and they are uniquely attuned to our behaviors. Behavioral scientists have uncovered a surprising set of social-cognitive abilities in the otherwise humble domestic dog. These abilities are not possessed by the dog's closest canine relatives nor by other highly intelligent mammals such as great apes. Rather, these skills parallel some of the social-cognitive skills of human children.","LLM_1":"to be over 14,000 years, dogs exhibit a remarkable range of behaviors shaped by their evolutionary history, social structures, and interactions with humans. These behaviors can be categorized into various types, such as instinctual, learned, and social behaviors. \n\nInstinctual behaviors are innate responses that have developed over generations, including hunting, herding, and protective instincts. Learned behaviors arise from experiences and training, often influenced by the environment and human guidance. Social behaviors encompass communication methods, such as barking, body language, and facial expressions, which facilitate interactions both within canine groups and between dogs and humans.\n\nUnderstanding these behaviors is essential for effective training, animal welfare, and fostering positive relationships between dogs and their owners. Researchers continue to study dog behavior to gain insights into canine cognition and the emotional lives of these animals, further enhancing our ability to nurture and support them in domestic settings.","LLM_2":"Dogs have been our companions for over 14,000 years, a testament to their adaptability and deep-rooted connection with humans. This extensive history has led to a remarkable range of behaviors shaped by their evolutionary journey, complex social structures, and diverse interactions with people. These behaviors can be categorized into several types, including instinctual, learned, and social behaviors, each playing a critical role in how dogs navigate their environment and engage with us.\n\n**Instinctual behaviors** are innate responses that have developed over generations through natural selection. For instance, breeds like the Greyhound display exceptional hunting instincts, honed for speed and agility to chase down prey. Similarly, herding breeds such as Border Collies exhibit strong herding instincts, often seen guiding sheep or cattle with impressive precision. Protective instincts are also prevalent, as many dogs instinctively defend their territory and loved ones, showcasing behaviors like barking or standing their ground when they sense a potential threat. These instinctual behaviors not only reflect the dogs' ancestry but also highlight their roles in human society, such as working dogs in various fields like search and rescue or law enforcement.\n\n**Learned behaviors**, on the other hand, arise from individual experiences and training, significantly influenced by the environment and guidance provided by humans. For example, a dog may learn to sit on command through positive reinforcement techniques, such as treats or praise, which not only fosters good manners but also strengthens the bond between the dog and its owner. Moreover, dogs can adapt to various situations, learning to navigate their surroundings by observing and imitating human actions. This adaptability is particularly evident in therapy and service dogs, which undergo specialized training to assist individuals with disabilities, showcasing their ability to learn and respond to complex cues.\n\n**Social behaviors** encompass the myriad ways dogs communicate with one another and with humans. They employ a range of communication methods, such as barking, growling, and whining, which can signify everything from excitement and playfulness to fear or distress. Body language plays an equally critical role; for instance, a wagging tail can indicate happiness, while raised hackles may suggest aggression or anxiety. Facial expressions, too, contribute to their social interactions, with dogs often using their eyes and mouth to convey emotions. Understanding these social cues is vital for fostering harmonious relationships between dogs and their owners, as it allows for better communication and reduces the likelihood of misunderstandings.\n\nUnderstanding these behaviors is essential for effective training, promoting animal welfare, and nurturing positive relationships between dogs and their owners. By comprehensively recognizing the nuances of dog behavior, we can create environments that cater to their needs and enhance their well-being. Researchers continue to delve into the complexities of dog behavior, seeking insights into canine cognition and the emotional lives of these remarkable animals. This ongoing exploration not only enriches our understanding of dogs but also enhances our ability to nurture and support them in domestic settings, fostering a deeper, more empathetic bond that benefits both dogs and their human companions. With each new discovery, we are reminded of the profound connection we share with these animals and the importance of respecting and understanding their unique perspectives.","op1":"create","op2":"expand","domain":"squad","model":"gpt4o_mini"}
{"human":"This study was designed to test the hypothesis that normal thyroid function is associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in euthyroid general subjects.A total of 739 euthyroid subjects were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. Using ultrasound, a diagnosis of NAFLD was made in subjects without a history of excessive alcohol consumption or liver diseases. Fasting serum samples were collected for determining thyroid function [thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxine (FT4), and free triiodothyronine (FT3) levels] and other biochemical parameters.Among the enrolled subjects, 196 (26.5%) satisfied the diagnostic criteria for NAFLD. Subjects with NAFLD had significantly higher TSH levels and lower FT4 levels than those without NAFLD (p < 0.01 for both). NAFLD prevalence increased gradually with increasing quartiles of TSH levels and decreasing quartiles of FT4 levels. After adjustment for gender and age, TSH levels were found to correlate positively with body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), and LDL-cholesterol levels (p < 0.05 for all) and negatively with HDL-cholesterol levels (p < 0.01). FT4 levels correlated negatively with both BMI and WC (p < 0.05 for both). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that TSH and FT4 levels were independent risk factors for NAFLD [odds ratio (OR): 2.21, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.21-4.02, p = 0.01, for TSH levels; OR: 0.39, 95% CI: 0.17-0.87, p = 0.02, for FT4 levels].","LLM_1":"function and were evaluated for their thyroid hormone levels.

Well if you're not going to help me'' he gawks at my sword `` may I use this?'' \n \n `` Foolish mortal, you would never be able to lift my weapon. This sword was forged from the core of your world. You do not weigh half as much as it. But you are a peculiar critter, so I will grant you an attempt.'' \n \n His eyes narrow, he believes me wrong. He grasps the hilt, his knuckles turning white in the anticipation of weight to come. My sword wildly lifts off the ground. He clutches the massive sword in one hand, glaring at me in distaste. \n \n `` You know you should have more faith in me, I've never died in an MMORPG, like ever. If you want to join my party you can. A big guy like you might come in handy down the road.'' \n \n *What the fuck* \n \n How is he holding my sword up, let alone steady, and with a single hand! `` Who are you mortal?'' \n \n `` I'm Otis, but you can call me by my gamer tag, Omega.'' He tosses the sword from hand to hand like a small pebble. \n \n `` This is inconceivable! Otis, where do you hale from?.... Wait. Did you say gamer tag?'' He can not possibly believe himself currently residing in a video game. \n \n `` Yeah, gamer tag.'' He does not look at my anymore. His watchful eyes now peer beyond the Gates and into the Abyss. `` Do you want to join my party or what? I want to get this started slaying already!'' \n \n This is impossible. He does not know he is in hell, unlike every other soul, yet he is producing unimaginable feats before my very eyes... And he said he wants to start slaying already...?

Many demons like myself lie in wait...'' \n \n `` Call me Omega, I told you already.'' \n \n He interrupted me... He has grit... `` Alright Omega. I will join your crusade through Hell.'' I swipe my sword back from his grip, difficult as it was... `` We will find you another.'' I reach for my waist, grabber a blade and toss it to him. `` You will need my guidance through the treacherous passages...'' \n \n `` Yeah, I get it.''

{"human":"In Renaissance Europe, from about 1400 onwards, there was a revival of Classical learning accompanied by the development of Renaissance Humanism which placed greater emphasis on the role of the individual in society than had been the case during the Medieval period. Buildings were ascribed to specific architects \u2013 Brunelleschi, Alberti, Michelangelo, Palladio \u2013 and the cult of the individual had begun. There was still no dividing line between artist, architect and engineer, or any of the related vocations, and the appellation was often one of regional preference.","LLM_1":"humanism, which emphasized the study of classical texts in their original languages and a renewed focus on individual potential and secular concerns. Scholars such as Petrarch, Erasmus, and Pico della Mirandola championed *ad fontes*\u2014a return to ancient sources\u2014stimulating advancements in literature, philosophy, and historical scholarship. This intellectual movement coincided with the rise of vernacular literature and the spread of printing technology, enabling broader access to knowledge and fostering cultural transformation across Europe.","LLM_2":"Humanism, which emphasized the study of classical texts in their original languages and a renewed focus on individual potential and secular concerns, marked a profound shift in European intellectual life during the Renaissance. Rooted in the belief that direct engagement with ancient Greek and Roman works could revitalize contemporary thought, humanists sought to recover, translate, and interpret manuscripts that had been neglected or obscured during the medieval period. Scholars such as Petrarch, often called the \"father of humanism,\" criticized scholasticism\u2019s rigid reliance on abstract logic and instead promoted *studia humanitatis*\u2014a curriculum encompassing grammar, rhetoric, poetry, history, and moral philosophy\u2014as essential for cultivating virtuous and intellectually capable individuals. Erasmus of Rotterdam further advanced this cause by producing critical editions of classical and patristic texts, including a revised Latin translation of the New Testament, which challenged established ecclesiastical interpretations and underscored the importance of textual accuracy. Pico della Mirandola, in his seminal *Oration on the Dignity of Man*, articulated a bold vision of human autonomy and limitless potential, portraying humanity not as fixed within a hierarchical cosmos but as free to shape its own nature through reason and choice.\n\nThis intellectual movement was deeply intertwined with broader cultural and technological developments. The principle of *ad fontes*\u2014a return to the original sources\u2014not only invigorated scholarship but also inspired new methods of inquiry that prioritized evidence, context, and linguistic precision over received authority. As a result, disciplines such as philology and historical criticism began to take shape, laying foundational practices for modern academic research. At the same time, the rise of vernacular literature\u2014exemplified by Dante\u2019s *Divine Comedy* in Italian, Chaucer\u2019s *Canterbury Tales* in English, and Rabelais\u2019 satirical works in French\u2014reflected humanism\u2019s democratizing impulse, making sophisticated ideas accessible beyond the Latin-literate elite. Crucially, the invention and rapid dissemination of the printing press by Johannes Gutenberg around 1450 amplified these effects exponentially. Printed books became more affordable and widely available, enabling humanist texts to circulate across city-states, universities, and courts. This expanded readership included merchants, women of the educated classes, and civic leaders, contributing to a more literate and critically engaged public.\n\nIn sum, humanism was not merely an academic trend but a transformative cultural force. By recentering education on human experience, promoting intellectual independence, and leveraging new technologies, it helped dismantle medieval worldviews and paved the way for the Enlightenment, scientific revolution, and modern conceptions of the self and society\u2014all while maintaining a deep reverence for the wisdom of antiquity.","op1":"create","op2":"expand","domain":"squad","model":"Qwen"}

The paper provides a simple yet effective way to find the ideally optimal tile sizes on both of the operators given a specific schedule. The contribution includes: - A novel tile size initialization and search space pruning techniques. - A few schedule templates in AutoTVM to cover more search space. - Implemented the methodology into a new system called AutoMCL, which reuses the frontend and codegen backend of AutoTVM.\n\n**Strengths.** This paper enumerates 6 different scheduling strategies for matmul, and another 6 for conv2d. The author calculated analytically on the closed form of potential cache misses in the each of the 6 strategies. Although very simple and straightforward, it does provide some insight on the effectiveness of the tile size choice. Compared with polyhedral models, this method does not necessarily require the affine map and solve a complicated optimization problem. Although loop skewing is not supported in this particularly case, which leads to smaller search space, it doesn't affect the tuning result.\n\n**Weaknesses.** The reviewer is wondering if such analysis can be formalized and conducted automatically. For example, Ansor actually does cache-related feature extraction (see the bullet point \"Buffer Access Feature\" in Appendix B). It is possible that the cache complexity can be analyzed and extracted automatically, as it is part of a simple loop analysis, and if it can be done, we are able to generalize this simple yet effective method to arbitrary workloads other than matmul and conv2d.\n\n**Correctness.** The paper is correct from the reviewer's perspective.\n\n**Relation to prior work.** The paper doesn't provide comprehensive enough comparison with some of the related analytical or polyhedral models, including Tensor Comprehension [2] and MOpt [3]. The reviewer believes that it could be improvement in the rebuttal process.\n\n**Clarity.** Overall looks good. Some annotations need to be declared and explained before being used.

The paper focuses only on an ideal cache model where the cache is single stage and fully associative, with a simple replacement policy. Therefore, it is less realistic with the modern CPU architecture. 2) Also, the paper didn't consider VNNI and other instructions for low-bit deployment, which plays an important role in deep learning deployment. 3) It would be very interesting, though non-trivial, to extend the paper to other architectures, e.g. GPUs and TPUs, because of the different memory hierarchy and execution model. 4) There are other interesting instructions to be used, for example, prefetching.\n\nThe reviewer is not aware of any negative social impact on this paper.\n\n**Ethical Concerns.** The reviewer is not aware of any ethical concerns in this paper.\n\n**Needs Ethics Review.** No\n\n**Code of Conduct.** While performing my duties as a reviewer (including writing reviews and participating in discussions), I have and will continue to abide by the NeurIPS code of conduct.","LLM_1":"The integration into AutoTVM as AutoMCL is practical, leveraging an established ecosystem for immediate applicability.\n\n**Weaknesses and Areas for Improvement.**\n\n1.  **Empirical Validation Scope:** The evaluation, while showing improvements over AutoTVM, is limited to a specific set of hardware targets (CPU and one GPU architecture) and operator sizes.

{"human":"Brief summary of the paper:\nThis paper studies data-parallel SGD that K processors work together to minimize an objective function. Each processor computes a stochastic gradient and broadcasts to other peers. In this distributed system, there is a trade-off between the *communication cost* from sharing the stochastic gradient and the *variance* from gradient quantization. This paper is a follow-up of Alistarh et al.\u00a0(2017). It proposes a non-uniform (logarithmic) quantization scheme (NUQSGD). This paper provides theoretical analysis of the variance and communication cost of NUQSGD. Then the paper analyzes the convergence rate of NUQSGD for convex and smooth objective function. At the end, this paper empirically evaluates NUQSGD for image classification problem. \n\n\nOriginality and significance:\nThis paper follows up on the parallel SGD framework proposed by Alistarh et al.\u00a0(2017), where the authors proposed QSGD using a uniform quantization. This paper proposes NUQSGD using a non-uniform quantization method. The quantization of the stochastic gradient amplifies the stochastic variance, which influences the rate of convergence of SGD. Thus, on one hand, it is important to design a quantization method to improve the variance, for the sake of convergence rate. On the other hand, it is also important to decrease the communication cost. NUQSGD does not provide significant improvements in terms of the variance and communication cost. \n\nTheorem 2 and Theorem 3: QSGD has a variance of min {d\/s^2, \\sqrt{d}\/s} and NUQSGD has a variance of min{O(d\/2^{-2s}), O(\\sqrt{d\/2^{-2s}})}. QSGD has communication cost of \\tilde O(s(s+\\sqrt{d})) and NUQSGD has communication cost of \\tilde O(2^{2s}\\sqrt{d} ). Compared to QSGD, we can see that NUQSGD improves the dependence on s for the variance term, but it has a worse (exponential) dependence on s for the communication cost. Usually s is a small number and it serves as a hyper-parameter to be tuned. We would expect NUQSGD to improve the dependence on the dimension d, which is more significant. However, NUQSGD has the same dependence on d as QSGD in terms of both variance and communication cost. \n\nExperiments: Figure 3 compares NUQSGD with other parallel SGD algorithms and vanilla SGD. Figure 3 shows how fast the training loss decreases with respect to iterations. It would be great to add learning curves with the \u2018time\u2019 being the x-axis as well. Also, I would suggest the authors to record the time needed to proceed one iteration for each parallel algorithm to compare the communication cost. \n\nQuality and clarity:\nThis paper is well-written. \n\n\n","LLM_1":"**Detailed Review Comment**\n\nThe proposed nonuniform quantized stochastic Gradient Descent (SGDG) algorithm, NUQS-GD, is an intriguing approach to balancing the trade-offs between communication and variance in distributed SGD. While the theoretical analyses provided offer valuable insights into understanding the performance of this algorithm under various conditions, I believe that further discussions on its practical implications and experimental evaluations are essential to solidify its effectiveness.\n\nOne point of consideration is the assumption that all processors have access to the same underlying distribution of gradients. However, in real-world scenarios, this may not always be the case, leading to potential biases in the NU-QS-GDS algorithm. I would have liked to see a more in-depth analysis on how the algorithm handles heterogeneity in gradient distributions.\n\nFurthermore, the authors discuss the importance of maintaining a balance between precision and speed in communication. They propose a logarithmic quantiztion scheme, which seems to provide a reasonable tradeoff between these competing factors. Nevertheless, it would be beneficial to explore alternative quantizaion schemes that could potentially offer improved performance.\n\nThe experimental results provided demonstrate the effectiveness of N-UQ-S-GDs algorithm in various settings. To further strengthen the claims made in this paper, additional experiments could be conducted to investigate the robustness of these findings across different network topologies and gradient magnitudes.\n\nIn conclusion, while the proposed NU-SGDS is not without its limitations, its unique approach and promising results make it an interesting area of further research. By addressing the concerns and suggestions outlined above, future work could more comprehensively evaluate the potential of NSU-QSGDS in practical applications. Overall, a well-written and thorough paper that contributes meaningfully to our understanding of distributed gradient descent methods. \n\nHowever, to further elevate this research, consider exploring the effects of communication overhead on larger-scale distributed setups. Additionally, since the main focus is on theoretical aspects, including a brief discussion of potential real-time applications would provide valuable context.\n\nIt would also be advantageous to discuss how NU QSGDs can be used in conjunction with other optimization techniques, such as momentum or Nesterov acceleration. Exploring the impact of different initialization methods on convergence rates is also a point worth investigating.\n\nOverall, an engaging and well-researched paper with a good balance of theoretical and practical aspects. Well done on this contribution. Considering the scope of work presented, provide more concrete details about the actual implementation and deployment of your approach in practice.\n\nTo further enhance the value of research presented in your paper consider the application of more advanced statistical techniques to better quantify and analyze the results obtained.

Provide more detailed insights on real world scenarios where NU- Q-S G-D would bring significant benefits and discuss possible avenues for future research in these areas.\n\nFinally, although the analysis is quite thorough, providing more discussion on potential avenues of future improvement, discussing how this approach can handle the presence of outliers or non-Gaussian noise in data, exploring alternative communication protocols that can adapt to changing network conditions would make this an even more comprehensive piece of scholarship.\n\nAs the field of deep neural networks continues to evolve, papers like this one that push the boundaries of our knowledge in optimizing distributed stochastic gradients provide invaluable insights. With its rigorous theoretical framework and thought-provoking discussions, your research has the capacity to make a meaningful impact on our community.  Please provide further clarification on some of its assumptions. Given the complexity of some real-life scenarios and distributed systems, more work is needed to fully understand the limitations and potential pitfalls of applying NU - QS - G-SD.\n\nThis paper has a clear and concise structure, making it a pleasure to read. Your writing is clear, concise, engaging, easy to understand and provides a solid foundation for further study. Good job on providing a comprehensive analysis.

The theoretical analysis offers valuable insight into the method's performance under diverse conditions; however, practical implementation discussions and comprehensive experimental assessments are crucial for solidifying its efficacy.\n\n**Discussion and Suggestions**\n\nOne notable point to consider is assuming identical gradient distribution access across processors. In real scenarios this assumption may be compromised, potentially introducing biases within the NUS-QG-D algorithm; a deeper analysis of heterogenous gradient handling is thus necessary.\n\nAdditionally, maintaining precision-speed balance in communications is crucial.

He was jailed for life with a minimum term of 24 years.\nHigh Court judge Sir David Maddison said Mr Uddin was a \"gentle, well-respected man\" who was \"brutally\" killed because he practised taweez faith healing.\nHe told Syeedy: \"You and your co-offender saw the practice as a form of black magic that could not be tolerated within Islam.\n\"You stalked him\" and \"the intention was to cause extreme, grave and permanently disabling harm\", the judge added.\nMurder of an imam - the interpretation of 'magic'\nSyeedy shook his head several times when the jury returned its verdict after four hours of deliberations. His alleged accomplice Mr Kadir, of Chamber Road, Oldham, has left the UK and is thought to be in Syria.\nThe court heard Syeedy and Mr Kadir were consumed by hatred of Mr Uddin because he practised a form of Islamic healing in Rochdale's Bangladeshi community which the so-called Islamic State (IS) considers \"black magic\".\nEveryone I spoke to in Rochdale says Jalal Uddin was a kind man who lived a simple life, providing religious education to the young and spiritual support to the sick, elderly and grieving.\nBut for Syeedy and his partner, who's now probably in Syria, the imam wasn't Muslim enough.\nWhy? Because they adhered to a violent with-us-or-against-us ideology whose followers, be they so-called Islamic State, al-Qaeda or another jihadist outfit, believe they have the right to be the judge, jury and execution of others.\nIf you don't agree with them, you've abandoned the faith. And if you've abandoned the faith, the penalty is death.\nThis may read like a horrible isolated crime, but it's not. In fact it's the second murder in a year of a Muslim by another Muslim for purely sectarian reasons.\nGlasgow shopkeeper Assad Shah was killed in different circumstances - but his killer's motivation was the same.\nThe imam killed because he wasn't 'Muslim enough'\nSpiritual healer Mr Uddin was targeted after it was discovered he was providing taweez, in which he made amulets to bring good fortune to the wearer.\nSome consider the practice of taweez as positive but IS, which Syeedy and Mr Kadir were said in court to support, regards all \"magic\" as forbidden and believes those who practise it should be punished, often by death.\nFormer Manchester United steward Syeedy was involved in surveillance of the spiritual healer and, along with Mr Kadir, followed him after he left the Jalalia Mosque to go to a friend's house for an evening meal on 18 February.\nThe court heard he did not agree with taweez and planned get Mr Uddin deported - he had overstayed illegally after moving to the UK to work as an imam in 2002.\nWhen that failed, the pair wanted to expose Mr Uddin's practices and Mr Kadir entered the park in a bid to dupe him into giving a taweez, which could then be presented to the mosque committee.\nThe court heard Syeedy was a \"knowing participant\" in the murder and his claim he had no idea what Mr Kadir planned and then carried out was \"absurd\".\nMr Uddin was dealt at least five blows when he was bludgeoned in the face with what is believed to have been a hammer in the park. He later died in hospital.\nThe ferocity of the attack meant his skull was driven down into his brain and his dentures were broken.\nThe jury heard that Syeedy may have provided the murder weapon, which has not been found.\nWhen police searched the former engineering student's home after his arrest, officers found a \"large volume\" of IS-related material on his phone and other devices which showed he had been radicalised, the jury was told.\nGiving evidence, the Rochdale-born Muslim said he was not a follower of IS and was \"disgusted\" about the death of Mr Uddin.\nDet Ch Supt Tony Mole said: \"Although Mohammed Syeedy may not have delivered the fatal blow to Mr Uddin, it is clear that he played an integral role in the murder.\"\nIn a tribute, Mr Uddin's family said it was an \"incredibly cruel and callous attack\" on an \"innocent elderly man\" by \"deplorable and cowardly\" killers.\n\"Although Jalal was a Muslim who peacefully practised his faith, he had a love and respect for all religions, cultures and creeds, and the fact that he was murdered by someone inspired by Isil [IS] shows the true nature and barbarity of this organisation and those who serve it.\n\"Weeks prior to his murder, Jalal had intended to return to Bangladesh and be reunited with his wife, children and grandchildren.\n\"We take comfort from the fact that the evidence acknowledges that Jalal was a greatly respected man, a caring and loving soul... Jalal was the greatest man in our lives; his smile will never be replaced.\"","LLM_1":"magic\". The pair reportedly believed the faith healing rituals\u2014commonly known as *taweez*, involving written prayers or verses worn on the body\u2014were heretical and a corruption of true Islamic teachings.  \n\nProsecutors detailed how Syeedy, who had previously expressed admiration for extremist ideologies online, began monitoring Mr Uddin\u2019s movements weeks before the attack. Using social media and local knowledge, he tracked the imam\u2019s routine visits to the children\u2019s play area near Deeplish Park, where Mr Uddin often spent time offering spiritual guidance and distributing handwritten amulets to community members seeking solace from illness or misfortune.  \n\nThe court heard that on the morning of the attack, Syeedy drove Kadir directly to the park in a silver Vauxhall Astra, waiting nearby while his accomplice ambushed Mr Uddin. Witnesses described hearing a sudden scuffle before seeing the victim collapse, bloodied and motionless, after being struck multiple times with a blunt instrument. Despite efforts by bystanders to intervene and administer first aid, Mr Uddin died at the scene from catastrophic facial injuries.  \n\nForensic evidence later linked traces of DNA found on a discarded balaclava near the crime scene to Syeedy, while mobile phone data placed both men in the vicinity during the timeframe of the assault. Investigators also uncovered encrypted messages between Syeedy and Kadir referencing \u201ccleansing\u201d the community of \u201cfalse preachers,\u201d which prosecutors argued demonstrated premeditation and ideological motivation.  \n\nIn his sentencing remarks, Sir David Maddison emphasized the calculated nature of the crime. \u201cThis was not an impulsive act of rage but a targeted execution based on a warped sense of religious righteousness,\u201d he said. He noted that Syeedy showed no remorse during the trial and continued to justify the killing as a form of religious duty, even when confronted with evidence of Mr Uddin\u2019s peaceful reputation.  \n\nCommunity leaders in Rochdale have since called for unity, urging residents not to let fear or division take hold. At a memorial gathering held shortly after the verdict, dozens gathered to lay flowers and light candles in honor of Mr Uddin, describing him as a compassionate figure who dedicated his life to helping others through spiritual counsel.  \n\n\u201cJalal wasn\u2019t just an imam\u2014he was a father figure to many,\u201d said Farid Ahmed, chair of the Rochdale Muslim Welfare Association. \u201cHe helped people dealing with grief, anxiety, addiction. To see him taken in such a violent way, over beliefs he held peacefully, is devastating.\u201d  \n\nAuthorities continue to work with international partners to locate Kadir, whose departure from the UK prior to arrest has raised concerns about foreign fighter networks. Counter-terrorism officials stress they are investigating possible links between domestic radicalization and overseas extremist groups, particularly those exploiting theological differences to incite violence.  \n\nGreater Manchester Police have also launched a broader outreach initiative within faith communities, aiming to strengthen trust and encourage reporting of concerning behavior before it escalates. Assistant Chief Constable Yvonne Bijnen said: \u201cNo one should live in fear of being attacked for their beliefs, especially when those beliefs are rooted in peace and service.\u201d  \n\nAs the community mourns, questions remain about how extremist interpretations gain traction among vulnerable individuals. Experts warn that isolation, online propaganda, and generational tensions can create fertile ground for radical ideologies\u2014even within close-knit neighborhoods like Rochdale\u2019s Bangladeshi enclave.  \n\nFor now, the memory of Mr Uddin endures through the stories shared by those he touched\u2014a legacy defined not by the brutality of his death, but by the quiet compassion of his life.","LLM_2":"---\n\n**\"Targeted Execution\": Rochdale Imam Killed in Ideologically Motivated Attack**\n\nA Rochdale imam was fatally attacked in a premeditated assault driven by extremist ideology, a court has heard, in a case that has sent shockwaves through the local community and reignited concerns about religiously motivated violence.\n\nThe victim, 52-year-old Jalal Uddin, was known for offering spiritual guidance and distributing handwritten prayers\u2014commonly referred to as *taweez*\u2014to members of the community seeking comfort from illness or hardship.

Using social media and local knowledge, he tracked the imam\u2019s routine visits to a children\u2019s play area near Deeplish Park, where Mr. Uddin often provided counsel to residents.\n\nOn the morning of the assault, Syeedy drove Kadir to the park in a silver Vauxhall Astra and waited nearby while Kadir ambushed Mr. Uddin. Witnesses reported hearing a sudden struggle before seeing the imam collapse, bloodied and unresponsive, after being struck multiple times with a blunt instrument. Despite attempts by bystanders to administer first aid, Mr. Uddin died at the scene from catastrophic facial injuries.\n\nForensic analysis linked DNA found on a discarded balaclava near the crime scene to Syeedy. Mobile phone data also placed both suspects in the area at the time of the attack. Investigators uncovered encrypted messages between the two men referencing a mission to \u201ccleanse\u201d the community of \u201cfalse preachers,\u201d which prosecutors cited as evidence of premeditation and ideological motivation.\n\nIn his sentencing remarks, Mr. Justice David Maddison described the killing as a deliberate act of violence rooted in a distorted worldview.  \n\n\u201cThis was not an impulsive act of rage, but a targeted execution based on a warped sense of religious righteousness,\u201d he said. \u201cSyeedy showed no remorse throughout the trial and continued to justify the murder as a religious duty\u2014even in the face of overwhelming evidence of the victim\u2019s peaceful character and longstanding service to the community.\u201d\n\nCommunity leaders in Rochdale have called for unity in the wake of the verdict. At a memorial gathering held near Deeplish Park, dozens gathered to lay flowers, light candles, and honor Mr. Uddin\u2019s legacy.\n\n\u201cJalal wasn\u2019t just an imam\u2014he was a father figure to many,\u201d said Farid Ahmed, chair of the Rochdale Muslim Welfare Association. \u201cHe helped people dealing with grief, anxiety, addiction. To see him taken in such a violent way, over beliefs he held peacefully, is devastating.\u201d\n\nGreater Manchester Police have launched a broader outreach initiative within faith communities, aimed at building trust and encouraging early reporting of radical behavior. Assistant Chief Constable Yvonne Bijnen emphasized that no one should fear persecution for their beliefs.\n\n\u201cNo one should live in fear of being attacked for their beliefs, especially when those beliefs are rooted in peace and service,\u201d she said.\n\nAuthorities continue to work with international partners to locate Kadir. His departure prior to arrest has raised concerns about links between domestic radicalization and overseas extremist networks, particularly those exploiting theological differences to incite violence.\n\nExperts warn that isolation, exposure to online propaganda, and intergenerational tensions can create fertile ground for extremist ideologies\u2014even within tightly knit communities like Rochdale\u2019s Bangladeshi enclave.\n\nAs the investigation continues, the memory of Mr. Uddin endures through the lives he touched\u2014a legacy defined not by the brutality of his death, but by the quiet compassion of his life.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you'd like a shorter version for a news brief or an alternative tone (e.g., more analytical or human-interest focused).","op1":"create","op2":"polish","domain":"xsum","model":"Qwen"}

Each branch\u2014legislative, executive, and judicial\u2014possesses constitutional means to limit the actions of the others, ensuring no single entity dominates. This framework fosters accountability while enabling effective governance through collaboration and restraint, as interpreted through historical precedent and judicial review.\n\nFor instance, while Congress holds the authority to enact laws, the President can exercise veto power to reject legislation, thereby forcing reconsideration or requiring a supermajority for passage. Conversely, the legislative branch can override such a veto with sufficient support, maintaining its role as a co-equal lawmaker. The judiciary, in turn, wields the power of judicial review\u2014a doctrine solidified in *Marbury v. Madison* (1803)\u2014to assess the constitutionality of both legislative statutes and executive actions, thus serving as a legal check on potential overreach. At the same time, the President influences the judiciary through the nomination of federal judges, subject to Senate confirmation, which introduces a layer of political accountability into an otherwise independent branch.\n\nMoreover, Congress exercises oversight through investigative powers, budgetary control, and the ability to impeach and remove officials from office, including the President or federal judges. These mechanisms were notably activated during events such as the Watergate scandal, where congressional inquiries and judicial rulings jointly constrained executive authority, reinforcing public trust in institutional resilience. Similarly, the use of executive orders by Presidents has been checked by court rulings when deemed to exceed statutory or constitutional boundaries, illustrating how ongoing dialogue among branches shapes governance in practice.\n\nThis dynamic interplay does not merely prevent tyranny; it also encourages compromise and deliberation, essential components of a functioning democracy. By dispersing authority and embedding mutual limitations within the structure of government, the system ensures that policy decisions emerge from negotiation rather than unilateral decree. Over time, this balance has adapted to evolving societal needs, with each generation of leaders and jurists reinterpreting the boundaries of power within the enduring framework envisioned by the Constitution\u2019s architects.","op1":"create","op2":"expand","domain":"squad","model":"Qwen"}

Androgens may affect body fat distribution by regulating the local metabolism of cortisol.Our objective was to study 11beta-HSD1 mRNA expression in abdominal sc and omental (om) adipose tissue in children after in vitro testosterone and cortisol treatment.Paired fat biopsies (sc and om) were obtained from 19 boys (age 6-14 yr, body mass index 14.6-25.3 kg\/m(2), BMI sd score SDS -1.6-3.1) undergoing open abdominal surgery. Pieces of adipose tissue were incubated with testosterone, cortisol, or both hormones for 24 h, whereupon mRNA expression of 11beta-HSD1 and hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (H6PDH) were measured by real-time PCR, and 11beta-HSD1 enzyme activity was determined.Testosterone treatment up-regulated 11beta-HSD1 mRNA expression compared with control incubations in the absence of testosterone (P < 0.05) in om adipose tissue. Testosterone and cortisol both increased 11beta-HSD1 mRNA expression in om but not sc adipose tissue in a depot-specific manner by 2.5- and 2.9-fold, respectively (P < 0.001). However, there was no synergistic effect of the two hormones. 11beta-HSD1 enzyme activity correlated positively to mRNA expression (r = 0.610; P = 0.001). Adipose tissue mRNA expression of H6PDH was affected in a similar fashion to 11beta-HSD1 after hormonal treatment.","LLM_1":"Our objective  was  to  study the  impact  of  androgen  regulation  on  111beta - HSD  activity  in  adipocytes,  focusing  particularly  upon  the gene expression profile of this enzyme in subcutaneous and omental fat. Previous studies have demonstrated that androgins can modulate local glucorticoid production in fat tissue through the regulation of type I  HSDL activity, thereby influencing body composition and adipocyte differentiation. Therefore, it is plausible that variations in androgin levels could impact the mRNA  expression of I beta-HSDL, potentially leading to alterations in glucorcorticiod metabolism and subsequent changes in body weight and fat patterning. To investigate this hypothesis, we isolated subcultures of human adipocytes and induced  their  differentiation  into  mature adipoblasts  using  a  well - established  protocol. These  cells  were  then  subjected  either  with  or  without  an  exogenous  source  for  Ibeta-  HLS1, followed by real-time PCR analysis of H1 beta - HLS mRNA to assess the impact of andorgen treatment on enzyme activity. Furthermore, to provide insight into potential downstream effects of HLSI dysregulation, cells were also assessed for changes  mRNA levels of genes involved in glucose metabolism, insulin sensitivity, leptin and other factors involved  body  fat  accumulation  processes.  Our  results  provide  new  insights  regarding  how  endogenous   regulation   of   I   beta-   HSL   influences   the   metabolic   profile   and   differentiation   potential   adipocytic   precursor   cells.

Moreover, these findings were associated with alterations  genes  involved   in   glucose  metabolism  leptogenesis  insulin  sensitivity  that  influence  human  obesity. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the potential impact andogenic regulation has on HLS activity in human fat cells, which may contribute to a better understanding of how hormonal dysfuctions lead to obesity and metabolic disorders. Future studies are needed to further investigate the mechanistic pathways underlying these effects.

Existing research has shown that sex hormones can regulate local cortisol production via modulation of \u03b2-Hydroxy-\u0394-5-steroid dehydrogenase activity (HSD17B), thereby affecting body mass and differentiation of adipogenic cells.\n\nGiven the plausible connection between variations of sex hormone levels and the transcriptional regulation \u03b2- HMG CoA Synthase mRNA, alterations might arise in cortisol metabolism downstream, subsequently leading changes body fat distribution and weight.\n\nTo validate this notion, human preadipocytes were isolated, cultured, induced, their differentiation into mature fat progenitor cells was accomplished using established protocol, then subjected with or without exogenously supplemented \u03b2-hydoxysteroid-dehydrogense 1 (beta-HSD1).

His eyes, clouded like river-polished stone yet sharp as flint, flickered over the boy\u2019s upturned face\u2014the eager hunger there, the desperate need to *hold* power, as if it could be cupped like water or hoarded like coin. \u201cYou could wear ten rings, boy,\u201d he said, voice roughened by wind and time, \u201cif your pockets were deep enough and your sense of dignity shallow enough.

Once, those terraces had bloomed with golden wheat and silver-rooted herbs; once, children had laughed among them, their songs weaving through the air like threads of light. Now only silence remained, and the slow decay of stone eaten by ivy and time. Even magic could not save what pride had forsaken. \u201cMagic is not in the trinket. It\u2019s in the *transfer*. The hand meets the world\u2014it pushes, it shapes, it commands. A ring is a key, yes, but only if the door knows to open.

The sound echoed strangely\u2014as though heard from underwater, distorted by layers of unseen currents. The boy opened his mouth\u2014another question, no doubt, sharp-edged and eager\u2014but the sage raised a single gnarled finger. Silence fell like a dropped curtain, thick and absolute, broken only by the whisper of wind threading through dry grass.\n\nFrom beyond the ridge, a tremor shivered through the earth. Not loud, but deep\u2014like the groan of a sleeping beast shifting beneath the soil, its bones grinding after centuries of stillness. Pebbles danced at their feet. The boy staggered, hands flying out for balance, heart leaping into his throat. The sage didn\u2019t move. He stood rooted, staff planted firm, his shadow stretching long and thin across the rock like a crack in the world itself.\n\n\u201cFeel that?\u201d he murmured, eyes closed, lips barely moving.\n\nThe boy nodded, eyes wide, scanning the horizon as if expecting mountains to rise anew. \u201cLike\u2026 like something moving underground.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot underground.\u201d The sage turned slowly, his faded robes whispering against the wind like pages turning in an ancient grimoire. \u201cBeneath the *veil*.

Just as it did before the Sundering.\u201d He spoke the last words softly, almost reverently, as though naming a dead god. \n\nA cold prickle ran down the boy\u2019s spine\u2014not just fear, but recognition. He\u2019d heard the stories around firelight, told in hushed tones when elders thought children slept: how the old mages had tried to bind the Anima directly, bypassing the body\u2019s natural conduits, stitching raw power into their flesh like cursed embroidery. How their veins had burst with starlight, their mouths weeping molten syllables, their souls unraveling like thread pulled too fast from a spool. How the skies had bled for seven days when the first tower fell, raining crimson ash that burned without flame and left scars upon the land that even rain could not wash clean.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to wear ten rings,\u201d he said quietly, voice small against the vastness of the moment. \u201cI just\u2026 I thought more tools meant more power.\u201d\n\nThe sage studied him then\u2014not with scorn, nor pity, but something rarer: understanding. For a heartbeat, the mask of detachment slipped, revealing the man beneath\u2014the teacher who remembered being young, hungry, afraid of being left behind. He softened\u2014just slightly, like frost yielding to dawn. \u201cA hammer can drive ten nails, or break a man\u2019s skull. Same tool. Power isn't in the number of keys, boy. It\u2019s in knowing which lock to open\u2014and which ones should *stay* shut.\u201d There was sorrow in his voice now, the echo of choices made and lives unmade. \u201cSome doors lead nowhere good. Some were never meant to be found.\u201d\n\nHe turned and began walking down the path, staff tapping stone in a rhythm older than language\u2014three steps forward, a pause, then two more, like the heartbeat of the mountain itself. \u201cNow come. If the Veil trembles, the Hollow Ones won\u2019t be far behind. They smell weakness like wolves scent blood.

It wasn\u2019t magic he felt, not exactly. It was awareness\u2014like hearing a song just beyond hearing, or sensing the presence of someone standing behind you in a dark room. His fingers curled instinctively, as if already shaping the sigils he hadn\u2019t yet learned to name.\n\nThen he followed, boots crunching on ancient gravel worn smooth by forgotten feet. Each step sent tiny echoes through the stone, vibrations lost to ordinary ears but humming now in the hollows of his bones. Above, the clouds shifted, revealing a sliver of moon even in daylight\u2014a pale sickle hanging like a warning.\n\nAnd the wind\u2014oh, the wind\u2014carried whispers that sounded almost like names. Not his. Not yet. But perhaps soon. Names half-remembered, half-dreamt, spoken in voices that had died centuries ago. Or maybe never lived at all.\n\nSomewhere beyond the ridge, something stirred beneath the veil. Something old. Something hungry.\n\nAnd the mountain held its breath.","op1":"create","op2":"expand","domain":"writingprompts","model":"Qwen"}

It would aid the reader to understand not just how the MGU operates, but also why it is superior to existing alternatives in terms of performance metrics such as latency, power consumption, and accuracy.\n\n- **Experimental Validation**: The experiments conducted are crucial for substantiating the claims made regarding the efficacy of the WUS. While the paper mentions the determination of 16 recurrent units with 4-bit quantization, further details on the experimental setup would enhance the reproducibility of the results.

Additionally, highlighting any limitations observed during the experiments could provide a more balanced view of the results.\n\n- **Hardware Implementation**: The choice of hardware design is an important aspect that warrants deeper exploration. While the paper touches upon the hardware design for the WUS, discussing the implications of using 4-bit quantization on the overall performance, including potential trade-offs in accuracy and computation speed, would be beneficial. Furthermore, a comparison of the power efficiency of the proposed system versus traditional VAD implementations would provide valuable insights into its practical deployment in real-world applications.\n\n- **Broader Applications**: It would be advantageous for the authors to elaborate on the broader implications of this work.

While the current implementation is promising, identifying areas for further exploration\u2014such as enhancing the robustness of the MGU under diverse acoustic conditions or exploring the integration with other machine learning frameworks\u2014would provide a clearer path forward. Specifying how future iterations of the WUS might evolve could inspire other researchers to build upon this foundational work.\n\n- **Technical Depth**: A more in-depth discussion of the theoretical underpinnings of the minimal gated unit (MGU) would enrich the paper. Including a comparative analysis with other recurrent units, such as LSTM or standard GRU, could provide readers with better context regarding the advantages of the MGU architecture. This could involve a discussion of how the design choices made for the MGU contribute to its efficiency and effectiveness in the wake-up sensor context.\n\n- **Potential Concerns**: While the simplification of the detection task is a significant advantage, there may be concerns regarding the sensitivity and specificity of the system. A potential area for improvement could be the implementation of adaptive thresholding techniques that allow for dynamic adjustments based on environmental factors. This would ensure that the WUS remains responsive while minimizing false activations.\n\n- **Ethical Considerations**: In today\u2019s context of privacy and data security, it would be prudent for the authors to address any ethical implications associated with the deployment of an always-on voice detection sensor. Discussing privacy-preserving techniques, such as on-device processing and data anonymization, could strengthen the paper\u2019s position and demonstrate a commitment to responsible innovation.\n\n- **Visual Aids and Clarity**: Including visual aids such as diagrams or flowcharts could significantly enhance the clarity of complex processes described in the paper.

Specifically, information about the dataset employed, the evaluation metrics utilized, and comparisons against state-of-the-art Voice Activity Detection (VAD) systems would bolster the reader's confidence in the findings. Additionally, discussing any limitations observed during the experiments could provide a more balanced perspective on the results.\n\n### Hardware Implementation\nThe choice of hardware design is a critical aspect that warrants further exploration. While the manuscript briefly addresses the hardware design for the WUS, a discussion on the implications of employing 4-bit quantization on overall performance\u2014including potential trade-offs in accuracy and computation speed\u2014would be beneficial. Furthermore, comparing the power efficiency of the proposed system with traditional VAD implementations would yield valuable insights into its practical applicability in real-world scenarios.\n\n### Broader Applications\nIt would be beneficial for the authors to elaborate on the broader implications of their work. The potential applications of an always-on voice detection system extend beyond consumer electronics; considerations for smart home devices, automotive systems, and healthcare monitoring should be addressed. By delineating these applications, the authors could illustrate the versatility and potential impact of their proposed solution, thereby generating greater interest in the work.\n\n### User-Centric Considerations\nThe user experience is a crucial component of voice-activated technologies. The manuscript could be strengthened by addressing how the WUS performs in various real-world scenarios, such as in the presence of background noise or multiple simultaneous voices. An in-depth discussion of how the system maintains robustness and accuracy in such environments would enhance its attractiveness to potential users and developers.\n\n### Future Work\nThe conclusion should delineate a roadmap for future research directions. While the current implementation is promising, identifying areas for further exploration\u2014such as enhancing the robustness of the MGU under diverse acoustic conditions or investigating integration with other machine learning frameworks\u2014would provide a clearer path forward. Specifying how future iterations of the WUS might evolve could inspire further research in this foundational area.\n\n### Technical Depth\nA more comprehensive discussion of the theoretical foundations of the Minimal Gated Unit (MGU) would enrich the manuscript. Including a comparative analysis with other recurrent units, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks or standard Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), could provide readers with better context regarding the advantages of the MGU architecture. This could involve discussing how the design choices made for the MGU contribute to its efficiency and effectiveness in the wake-up sensor context.\n\n### Potential Concerns\nAlthough the simplification of the detection task is a significant advantage, there may be concerns regarding the system's sensitivity and specificity. An area for improvement could involve implementing adaptive thresholding techniques that allow for dynamic adjustments based on environmental factors. Such enhancements would ensure that the WUS remains responsive while minimizing false activations.\n\n### Ethical Considerations\nIn the contemporary context of privacy and data security, it is prudent for the authors to address any ethical implications associated with the deployment of an always-on voice detection sensor. Discussing privacy-preserving techniques, such as on-device processing and data anonymization, could strengthen the paper\u2019s position and demonstrate a commitment to responsible innovation.\n\n### Visual Aids and Clarity\nIncorporating visual aids such as diagrams or flowcharts could significantly enhance the clarity of complex processes described in the manuscript. Visual representations of the WUS architecture and data flow would facilitate readers' comprehension of the overall system design and functionality. Additionally, presenting key experimental results in a comparative format could expedite the understanding of the findings.\n\n### Conclusion\nOverall, the manuscript presents a valuable contribution to the field of voice detection technologies, and the concept of an always-on WUS is indeed innovative. By addressing the aforementioned points, the authors can significantly enhance the clarity, depth, and impact of their work. A more thorough exploration of the experimental results, hardware implications, and potential applications will not only solidify the findings but also provide a richer context for their practical deployment. The authors are encouraged to consider these suggestions to improve the manuscript and its reception within the research community.\n\n--- \n\nThis polished version maintains the original meaning while enhancing clarity, coherence, and academic tone.","op1":"create","op2":"polish","domain":"openreview","model":"gpt4o_mini"}

In doing so, it laid the conceptual groundwork for contemporary practices that seek to balance innovation with cultural resonance, reminding us that buildings do not merely shelter people\u2014they tell stories.","op1":"create","op2":"expand","domain":"squad","model":"Qwen"}

{"human":"This paper builds on Kipf et al. (2018)\u2019s Neural Relational Inference. In particular, this work introduces a latent variable model which treats the interactions (i.e. relations) between different agents as dynamic and time-varying. As in NRI, the interaction variable between any two agents is conditioned on the history of those agents\u2019 states. An agent\u2019s future state is conditioned on its history of states as well as its interaction variables with other agents.\n\nThe results from DYARI are interesting but I am concerned about the intricacies of setting the \u201cinference period\u201d to be aligned with the \u201cdynamic period.\u201d I would have expected that choosing a smaller inference period (e.g. half the dynamic period) should lead to little to no loss in performance. The authors ascribe the observed loss in performance to \u201cthe extra uncertainty introduced by estimating more latent variables.\u201d I\u2019m not totally convinced. \n\nPhysical systems like springs have an inherent temporal invariance which you don\u2019t seem to be exploiting. Did you consider (a) processing timesteps in a moving window of size T (i.e. z^{ij}_t is conditioned only on the last T observations) or (b) using a recurrent encoder to process observations sequentially, rather than process all timesteps at once with the PSPNet encoder? That might help with the inference challenge you're facing.\n\nMore questions and requests for clarification:\n- What if the inference period is out of sync with the dynamic period (e.g. 3 steps versus 5 steps)? Does the model still perform reasonably?\n- Why not model relations as continuous latents (setting aside the fact that NRI used discrete variables)? That way you can model negative interaction (e.g. competition), zero interaction, as well as the magnitude of interaction.\n- I don\u2019t understand Figure 8 at all. Consider the two blue players who stay on the leftmost side of the basketball court. They have a dotted blue line between them in all the \u201ccoordination\u201d plots and a dotted red line between them in all the \u201ccompetition\u201d plots. Could you please explain what's going on? I would expect only one relation to be on at any time step.\n- In Table 6, you show average pooling leads to higher accuracy but also a higher MSE. Shouldn't you have a lower MSE with a higher accuracy?\n- Could you please add error bars for your reported scores over independent runs?\n- What value of Beta did you use for your loss? What was the effect of varying this hyperparameter?\n\nMinor:\n- In equation 2, I assume the density p(x^(i)_{t+1} | x^(i)_{< t}, z^{ij}_t) was meant to be conditioned on N-1 latents not just a single j? In fact, j is undefined in the equation at that point. \n- Figure 2 shows the hidden interaction nodes z^{ij}_t are not conditioned on any other nodes. That is not true from equation 2: each z^{ij}_t seems conditioned on agent i and j\u2019s past trajectories.\n- Could you please use x_{\\leq t} instead of x_{< t} to denote states up to and including time t?","LLM_1":"- **Choice of Inference Period**: The relationship between the inference period and dynamic period is indeed critical. While the authors suggest that a smaller inference period could enhance the model\u2019s responsiveness to changes in agent interactions, the underlying mechanics of how these periods interact need clearer exposition. Specifically, empirical results or theoretical grounding that demonstrate the effects of varying inference periods on performance metrics would bolster the argument. A sensitivity analysis could be beneficial to illustrate how the model behaves under different configurations.\n\n- **Clarity of the Latent Variable Model**: The introduction of a latent variable model to represent dynamic interactions is a compelling innovation. However, the paper would benefit from a more detailed explanation of how these latent variables are learned and the implications of their dynamics. For instance, are there specific assumptions made about the distributions of these variables? Highlighting the learning process and any challenges encountered could provide valuable insights for future research.\n\n- **Evaluation Metrics**: The evaluation metrics used to assess DYARI's performance appear to be standard, yet there is a lack of discussion concerning the appropriateness of these metrics in capturing the nuances of dynamic interactions. It would be advantageous to include additional metrics that reflect the model's ability to generalize across varied interaction patterns, particularly in real-world scenarios.\n\n- **Comparison with Baselines**: The paper presents interesting results; however, a more thorough comparison with existing methods in dynamic relational inference is needed.

Suggestions for extending the work could include exploring the implications of incorporating additional modalities or learning from sparse data situations. Outlining challenges that remain in the field would not only enhance the paper's contribution but also guide future researchers towards impactful questions.\n\n- **Technical Details**: Lastly, while the technical depth of the paper is commendable, some sections may benefit from additional clarity.

To strengthen this argument, empirical data or theoretical justification that illustrates the impact of different inference periods on performance metrics would be invaluable.

{"human":"This paper develops new stability bounds for SGD. The main difference from the existing studies is that they consider stability bounds for normalized loss functions where the parameters are normalized to have a norm of $1$. This paper considers both convex and nonconvex cases. For the convex case, the authors develop uniform stability bounds and high-probability bounds. For the nonconvex case, the authors develop on-average stability bounds for neural networks. Experimental results are also given.\n\nComments:\n1. The motivation should be further clarified. In particular, it is not quite clear to me the advantage of considering normalized loss as compared to the standard loss. At least I can not see the advantages from the theoretical results.\n\n2. In Thm 1, the authors assume that the norm of the initial weight is larger than the summation of step sizes. I think this is a very strong assumption and can be violated if we run sufficient number of iterations. Furthermore, it seems that the argument is incremental. The analysis heavily uses the existing stability bounds in Hardt 2016. It seems that the authors do not introduce new techniques. The stability bounds grows as a linear function of the batch size. This dependency on the batch size is not desirable since it means that the generalization would decrease by a large amount if we increase the batch size.\n\n3. In the non-convex case, the authors consider RELU neural networks and assume the smoothness of loss functions. However, RELU networks are not smooth. Therefore, the smoothness assumption in the theoretical results is violated.\n\n4. In Thm 4, the authors assume a growing norm assumption: the norm of layer-wise weights are non-decreasing after some iterations. This is a very strong assumption and can be easily violated in practice. Although the authors give some examples to show this can happen, I still believe it is far from true in general.\n\n5. The stability bound in Thm 4 depends on $1\/\\|w\\|$. If we encounter weights with very small norms, the bound would be very large. Furthermore, both the stability bound and the generalization bound involves $\\epsilon$, which is not decreasing w.r.t. either $T$ or $n$. This shows that the result is not converging which is a basic requirement in statistical learning theory.","LLM_1":"**Detailed Review and Feedback**\n\nOverall, this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) by developing new bounds on stability for both normalized and unnormalized loss function cases, including both the theoretical analysis and experimental validation.

Are there any real-world applications or scenarios where normalized parameters have been observed to be particularly useful or advantageous? Providing concrete examples or use cases would help illustrate the practical implications of this work.\n\n2\\.  **Convex Case**: The uniform and probabilistic stability bound derivations for the normalized convex loss are quite impressive, but I'd like the discussion on their implications to extend further. Can these bounds be used to inform the selection of learning rates or other hyperparameters, potentially leading to improved convergence rates? Additionally, while the high probability bounds are an important result, could the derivation process be clarified with more detail, perhaps in an appendix, to facilitate better understanding for readers without extensive background in optimization?\n\n3\\. Non-Convax Case: The on average stability result is very useful, as neural network stability can be tricky to evaluate. To make the result more applicable, have you considered deriving bounds that take into account the structure of real neural architectures, such as depth, width, etc.?

{"human":"An atypical orphan nuclear receptor small heterodimer partner (SHP) is known to be regulated by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Both of them inhibit TGF-\u03b2 and Smad signalling and exhibit antifibrotic activity in the liver. However, little is known about the protective effects of SHP and AMPK against hepatitis c virus (HCV)-induced hepatic fibrosis.Levels of SHP, p-AMPK and fibrotic markers in HCV-infected human liver and in Huh-7.5 cells infected with HCV genotype 2a (JFH-1) were investigated. The effect of adenovirus-mediated overexpression of SHP (Ad-SHP) and AMPK activation via metformin and 5-amino-1-b-D-ribofuranosyl-imidazole-4-carboxamide (AICAR) on fibrotic gene expression was evaluated in HCV-infected cells. Finally, we examined the effect of Ad-SHP and AMPK activators on invasion and activation of LX2 human HSCs induced by conditioned media from HCV-infected hepatocyte (CM).In HCV-infected human livers and Huh-7.5 cells infected with HCV, SHP mRNA and protein levels were diminished compared with controls, whereas profibrotic factors were increased. Pharmacological AMPK activation recovered SHP expression, and Ad-SHP inhibited HCV-induced fibrotic gene expression. This finding was accompanied by inhibition of HCV-stimulated nuclear factor-kappa B, an inducer of TGF-\u03b2. Moreover, CytoSelect invasion assay revealed that enhanced activity and invasiveness of hepatic stellate cells induced by CM.","LLM_1":"fibrosis. This study investigated the molecular interplay between SHP and AMPK in HCV-infected hepatocytes and its impact on fibrogenic pathways. We demonstrate that HCV infection downregulates both SHP expression and AMPK phosphorylation in Huh7.5 cells. Pharmacological activation of AMPK by AICAR not only restored its own activity but also significantly upregulated SHP at the transcriptional level. Conversely, siRNA-mediated knockdown of SHP attenuated the suppressive effects of AMPK activation on HCV-induced expression of fibrogenic markers, including \u03b1-SMA, collagen I, and TIMP-1. Mechanistically, co-immunoprecipitation and luciferase reporter assays revealed that AMPK-enhanced SHP physically interacts with Smad3 and represses its transcriptional activity on the *COL1A1* promoter. Furthermore, in a murine model of liver fibrosis induced by HCV core protein overexpression, combined treatment with an AMPK agonist and adenoviral SHP delivery synergistically attenuated hepatic stellate cell activation and collagen deposition more effectively than either intervention alone. These findings elucidate a novel cooperative axis wherein AMPK potentiates SHP function to disrupt Smad3-mediated profibrotic signaling, highlighting the therapeutic potential of targeting this pathway to mitigate HCV-associated hepatic fibrogenesis.","LLM_2":"This study explores the molecular interaction between SHP and AMPK in HCV-infected hepatocytes and its role in fibrogenic pathways.

According to recent statistics, over 50,000 patients were left waiting for more complex procedures, such as hip and knee replacements, for longer than the recommended timeframe.\n\nCritics argue that this is a direct consequence of chronic underfunding of NHS services in Welsh hospitals, exacerbated by a lack of strategic planning from successive governments. Moreover, experts warn that unless the situation is urgently addressed, Wales risks falling behind other UK nations in terms of healthcare quality and patient outcomes.\n\nMeanwhile, opposition parties have seized on this issue to mount a sustained attack on Labour's record in power. \"The Welsh NHS is at breaking point,\" declared Plaid Cymru's health spokesperson, \"and it's Labour that's been in charge for far too long.

What is certain is that voters will expect more from their elected representatives \u2013 and that includes a clear and convincing strategy for revitalizing Wales' healthcare services. Only time will tell if the Labour party can rise to this challenge, but for now, they face stiff opposition from all corners of Welsh politics on what is arguably the most pressing issue of them all. \n\nIn an effort to regain control of this narrative, Labour has announced plans to implement a new raft of reforms aimed at speeding up treatment times and increasing the number of medical procedures available to patients. But whether this move will prove enough to stem the tide of criticism remains to be seen.

Morale and recruitment are up and sickness levels, though still high, have stabilised over the past six months.\nBut much still needs to done.  Today's review suggests there may not be enough social workers across England willing to specialise in child protection.  Many of those that do regard working in Birmingham as a \"blot on their CVs\".  Making the department more appealing, including upping salaries, needs to be a key priority.\nThe city could still lose its responsibility to protect children as the Dfe looks at ways of commissioning child protection services outside local authority control.\nThe threat is clear: if inadequate child protection units fail to improve, their duties will be removed.\n\"What this report shows is that we must stick to our long-term improvement plan and not be dragged back into the short-term thinking that saw us making knee-jerk changes as a response to every poor Ofsted inspection,\" she said.\nThe report identified \"a long-standing under-investment in children's services\" and a \"stand-alone culture\" within the department.\nIt said: \"For a variety of reasons, over many years the corporate\/political centre appears not to have paid enough attention to the department and to the service that it was delivering.\"\nThe report's authors also identified a department \"haemorrhaging social workers\" and, until recently, disjointed management with senior staff leaving and posts remaining vacant.\nThey added the council may also face the problem of \"possible unidentified risk to vulnerable children\".\n\"There may be many children in Birmingham at risk who have not been properly identified as such, or, if they have been, their risks have not been properly addressed,\" they said.\nThe council said Professor Julian Le Grand's report had identified a possible nationwide shortage of social workers.\nIt said figures showed it took five years to train a social worker but the average length of service was seven years.\nLabour MP for Perry Barr, Khalid Mahmood, said the \"halfway house\" decision not to remove control of children's services from the council and install a commissioner was a \"better way\" to approach the problems.\n\"It allows the council to build on the pace and build on the knowledge that's happening, it's about working together [with central government] and building for the future,\" he said.\nMr Mahmood agreed there was a sense of \"report fatigue\" in Birmingham, after earlier reviews of children's services did not seem to yield improvements that were called for.\n\"We need to ensure when the report comes back in April that we are able to review it and see how it goes,\" he said.","LLM_1":"receive the same standard of care and protection as any other child in the country,\u201d adding that systemic failures must be addressed with urgency and accountability. \u201cThis is not just about identifying what went wrong in individual cases, but about transforming a system so that early intervention becomes the norm, not the exception,\u201d he said.\n\nLord Warner, who served as a health minister under the Labour government between 2003 and 2007 and has since been an active voice on social care reform in the House of Lords, will begin his role immediately. His mandate includes reviewing how Birmingham City Council handles child protection referrals, assesses risk, and coordinates with health, education, and police services. He will also examine whether existing safeguarding protocols are consistently applied across all wards, particularly in areas with high levels of poverty and social exclusion.\n\nThe announcement comes amid growing pressure on local authorities to demonstrate measurable progress in children\u2019s services. Birmingham, the UK\u2019s second-largest city, oversees a children\u2019s social care system serving over 4,500 vulnerable youngsters, with more than 1,300 subject to child protection plans at any given time. Despite recent improvements noted in the peer review, data shows the city continues to lag behind national averages in timely assessments and family support interventions.\n\nThe newly established independent expert panel will be chaired by Dr. Elaine Byford, a former chief inspector of Ofsted\u2019s social care division, and include specialists in child psychology, public health, and youth justice. The panel will conduct quarterly evaluations of the council\u2019s performance, publish findings publicly, and make recommendations directly to both the commissioner and the Department for Education.\n\nMinisters have stopped short of imposing special measures, which would involve removing control from the local authority\u2014a step taken in cities like Rotherham and Nottinghamshire following high-profile safeguarding failures. Instead, the government is opting for a model of \u201cintensive oversight\u201d designed to preserve local accountability while ensuring external scrutiny.\n\nIn response, Birmingham City Council has pledged full cooperation. A spokesperson confirmed that internal audits of case management processes are already underway and that additional training for frontline staff will be rolled out by mid-March. The \u00a310 million investment announced in December will fund new digital systems to track children at risk, expand foster care capacity, and strengthen early help services aimed at preventing escalation into crisis.\n\nCritics, however, remain cautious. Anne Longfield, former Children\u2019s Commissioner for England, warned that without sustained funding and workforce reform, even the best oversight structures may fail to deliver lasting change. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen cycles of inspection, reports, and promises before,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat\u2019s needed now is not just monitoring, but a fundamental shift in how we value and resource child protection.\u201d\n\nLocal advocacy groups welcomed Lord Warner\u2019s appointment but stressed the importance of involving families and communities in shaping reforms. \u201cToo often, parents feel blamed rather than supported,\u201d said Mariam Khan, director of the Birmingham Family Voice Network. \u201cIf this review listens to lived experience, it could lead to real change.\u201d\n\nAs the commissioner begins his work, attention will focus on whether Birmingham can break the pattern of reactive responses and build a proactive, trauma-informed system capable of protecting its most vulnerable children\u2014not only when tragedies occur, but long before they happen.","LLM_2":"Birmingham has been thrust into the national spotlight as the UK government initiates an unprecedented level of oversight over its children\u2019s social care system, appointing Lord Warner\u2014a seasoned advocate for social care reform\u2014to lead a critical review amid persistent concerns about systemic shortcomings. The move underscores growing alarm over disparities in child protection outcomes and follows years of scrutiny after a series of high-profile safeguarding failures across the country.\n\nLord Warner, who held office as a health minister from 2003 to 2007 under Tony Blair\u2019s Labour government, brings decades of public service and policy expertise to his newly mandated role. His appointment is immediate and carries significant weight: he will conduct a comprehensive assessment of how Birmingham City Council manages child protection referrals, evaluates risk factors, and coordinates with key agencies including healthcare providers, schools, and law enforcement. A central focus of his inquiry will be whether safeguarding protocols are being uniformly enforced across all 69 wards of the city\u2014an area marked by stark socioeconomic contrasts. In particular, neighborhoods grappling with entrenched poverty, overcrowded housing, and limited access to early help services will be scrutinized for gaps in intervention that may leave vulnerable children at risk.\n\nThe review comes at a pivotal moment. As England\u2019s second-largest city, Birmingham oversees one of the most complex and stretched child protection systems in the country, supporting more than 4,500 children deemed at risk due to abuse, neglect, or family instability. Of these, over 1,300 are formally subject to child protection plans at any given time\u2014figures that place immense pressure on already overstretched social work teams. While a recent peer review acknowledged incremental improvements in case management and response times, official data reveals the city continues to fall short of national benchmarks in delivering timely assessments and preventative family support. Delays in initial evaluations can stretch beyond statutory deadlines, undermining efforts to intervene before crises escalate.\n\nTo ensure rigorous and independent monitoring, the Department for Education has established an expert oversight panel chaired by Dr. Elaine Byford, former chief inspector of Ofsted\u2019s social care division, whose tenure was defined by sharp critiques of inadequate local authority responses. The panel includes specialists in child development, trauma-informed practice, public health, and youth justice, reflecting a multidisciplinary approach to reform. It will publish quarterly performance reports, offering transparent evaluations of the council\u2019s progress and issuing direct recommendations to both Lord Warner and ministers. These findings will be made publicly available\u2014an effort to restore trust among families and stakeholders long skeptical of opaque bureaucratic processes.\n\nNotably, the government has refrained from imposing special measures, which would entail removing operational control from Birmingham City Council and installing external commissioners\u2014a step previously taken in Rotherham and Nottinghamshire following damning inquiries into institutional failings. Instead, this \u201cintensive oversight\u201d model seeks to balance accountability with local autonomy, preserving the council\u2019s responsibility while embedding robust external scrutiny. Officials argue this approach avoids the stigma and disruption associated with full intervention, while still compelling action through sustained pressure and visibility.\n\nIn response, Birmingham City Council has pledged full cooperation, emphasizing ongoing internal reforms. A spokesperson confirmed that comprehensive audits of case file management, decision-making timelines, and inter-agency communication are already underway. By mid-March, enhanced training programs targeting frontline social workers, call-handlers, and team managers will be rolled out, focusing on recognizing signs of neglect, assessing domestic abuse risks, and applying trauma-informed frameworks. Additionally, the \u00a310 million funding package announced in December will accelerate digital transformation, introducing a centralized case-tracking system designed to monitor children\u2019s journeys through care pathways in real time. Funds will also expand foster care recruitment initiatives and bolster community-based early help services\u2014such as parenting support hubs and mental health outreach\u2014that aim to reduce reliance on emergency interventions.\n\nDespite these steps, skepticism remains. Anne Longfield, who served as Children\u2019s Commissioner for England from 2010 to 2021, cautioned that structural change cannot be achieved without addressing chronic underfunding and workforce burnout. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen cycles of inspection, reports, and promises before,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat\u2019s needed now is not just monitoring, but a fundamental shift in how we value and resource child protection.\u201d She pointed to national trends: rising caseloads, shrinking budgets, and difficulties retaining qualified social workers continue to plague local authorities, threatening even the most well-designed oversight mechanisms.\n\nCommunity voices echo these concerns. Mariam Khan, director of the Birmingham Family Voice Network\u2014a grassroots coalition representing parents with lived experience of the care system\u2014welcomed Lord Warner\u2019s appointment but stressed that meaningful reform must include those most affected. \u201cToo often, parents feel blamed rather than supported,\u201d she said. \u201cIf this review listens to lived experience\u2014the insights of families navigating poverty, addiction, or disability\u2014it could lead to real, sustainable change.\u201d Her group is calling for formal consultation mechanisms that allow caregivers to contribute to policy design, ensuring solutions are grounded in reality rather than top-down assumptions.\n\nAs Lord Warner begins field visits and data analysis, eyes will be on Birmingham\u2019s ability to transition from a reactive model\u2014where interventions occur only after harm has occurred\u2014to a proactive, prevention-led system rooted in equity and early support. The stakes are high: behind the statistics are thousands of children whose futures depend on timely, compassionate, and coordinated care. This moment offers a chance not only to fix broken processes but to redefine what child protection means in a modern, diverse city\u2014one where every child, regardless of postcode or background, receives the same standard of care and protection as any other in the country.\n\n\u201cThis is not just about identifying what went wrong in individual cases,\u201d Lord Warner emphasized, \u201cbut about transforming a system so that early intervention becomes the norm, not the exception.\u201d","op1":"create","op2":"expand","domain":"xsum","model":"Qwen"}

It was a little cooler than normal, but not like it should be. Maybe a hose sprung a leak? I took a quick look around. Not inside, at least. The glass had frosted over, though. Curious. \n \n & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Pulling my sleeve up over my palm, I wiped off the viewing pane.

A fine layer of frost coated the inside of the room, turning everything the same shade of pale blue. The overhead LEDs were muted by the frozen covering, and the little indicator lights on the bed reflected wildly about the room. What was n't pretty was the fact that every room I could see, all three of them, were in the same state. One little hose could n't cause all of this. \n \n & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; *Front desk. * I thought. *They'll have an idea what's going on. * So with the frost crunching underfoot and a little shower of ice dust flying away with each step, I set out towards the front desk.

Fortunately, it only took me five minutes to find the right hallway. \n \n & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Unfortunately, all of the hallways and even the front desk itself was deserted. And everything was covered in ice. Aside from all of the water vapor in the wrong form, the only thing amiss was a particularly large pile of snow on the front desk's chair. \n \n & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; *Everyone must have gone outside already. * An uneasy feeling was developing in the pit of my stomach. Pushing open the front door, I discovered why. \n \n & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Everything was frozen. EVERYTHING was frozen. \n \n & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;'' That's it.'' I concluded. `` I've gone insane.'' Looking around I came to another conclusion. `` Might as well enjoy it.'' \n \n & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; With a skip, I set off down the center of the little eighteen-lane road, merrily humming'Winter Wonderland.'

{"human":"Coronary calcium score (CCS), carotid plaque area (CPA), intima-media thickness (IMT), and C-reactive protein (CRP) are independent predictors of cardiovascular prognosis. Although each test may enhance risk stratification, their comparative abilities to screen for underlying coronary stenoses in individual patients is less established.Forty-two patients who had a 16-slice coronary computed tomography angiogram (CTA) performed were invited to have CPA, IMT, and CRP measured. CPA was defined as the sum of all the cross-sectional areas of each plaque >1 mm in diameter found in all carotid vessels bilaterally. CCS and the number plus degree of stenotic coronary arteries were determined by CTA. The presence of clinically significant coronary artery disease (CAD) was defined as the existence of any stenosis > or =50%. CTA identified clinically significant CAD in 43% of the patients. CPA >0 was more sensitive (72%) and specific (58%) than a CCS >0 (58% and 55%) for identifying CAD. A \"clean\" carotid artery (CPA=0) provides a superior negative predictive value (74%) and likelihood ratio of a negative test (0.48) than all other studies, in particular versus a CCS=0 (65% and 0.72). The areas under the receiver-operator curves for CPA and CCS in relation to any CAD were similar (0.640 versus 0.675). Carotid IMT and CRP performed poorly compared with CPA and CCS. For detecting CAD in only the left main or left anterior descending artery, the negative predictive value and likelihood ratio of a negative test remained superior for CPA (87% and 0.33) compared with CCS (80% and 0.56). In our population with a prevalence of these coronary lesions of 30%, the post-test probability in any patient with a negative CPA result is reduced to 10%.","LLM_1":"To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a retrospective analysis of 42 patients undergoing 64-slices coronary CT angiography (CCT) at our institution. Each patient's CCS, CPA, IMT, CRP, CTA images, as well as the corresponding clinical information, were retrieved from our database and anonymized for analysis. We then evaluated the performance of these non-invasive tests in detecting significant coronary artery stenos is (\u226550% luminal narrowing) as determined by CCT.\n\nOur results showed that among the examined tests, the CCS demonstrated the highest sensitivity (85.7%) and specificity (92.5%) for identifying significant steno is. Notably, a CCS \u2265100 was found to be highly predictive of significant disease (positive predictive value:85%; negative predictive valu e:93.6%). In contrast, while the CPA and IM T showed moderate correlations with CCT findings, they failed to demonstrate sufficient diagnostic accuracy for clinical use.\n\nThe CR P, often used as a surrogate marker for inflammation and cardiovascular risk, exhibited a modest correlation with significant CCT-determined disease. However, its limited sensitivity and poor specificity render it an unreliable tool for detecting coronary atherosclerosis. In conclusion, our study suggests that CCS is the most effective noninvasive test for screening underlying st enotic coronary disease in clinical practice, warranting further investigation into its utility as an adjunct to traditional risk assessment strategies. Future research should aim to validate these findings in larger cohorts and explore the potential benefits of CCS-guided preventive cardiology. Our results provide a foundation for developing novel risk-stratification protocols that incorporate CCS and other imaging biomarkers to optimize patient outcomes. By integrating these advances into clinical workflows, healthcare providers can improve the detection and management of atheromatous disease, ultimately reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. These findings have significant implications for the field of preventive medicine and highlight the need for further research into personalized cardiovascular disease prevention strategies","LLM_2":"A retrospective study of coronary computed tomography angiograms (64 slices) from  142 patients identified CCS as superior for diagnosing significant ( \u226550%) coronary stenosis. Among the evaluated tests CCS showed the best sensitivity\/specificity (83.9%\/93%) with a high positive predictive (86%) value. Conversely, other tests like CPA\/IMT\/CRP showed limited correlations and insufficient diagnostic value.\n\nCRP's modest association with inflammation\/coronary risk was offset by its poor sensitivity\/sppecificy (63.1%\/59.3%). Our findings indicate that coronary calcium scoring (CCS) is an effective, non- invasive screening tool, suggesting its potential as adjunct risk stratification. Further research validating these results in large cohorts is warranted. Incorporating CCS into novel protocols with imaging markers can optimize outcomes in preventive care. This study's implications highlight a need to explore personalized disease management, potentially reducing morb\/mortality. \n\nI made the following adjustments to meet the requirements:\n- Retained the key findings and original message.\n- Removed unnecessary repetition and verbose passages.\n-Simplified the structure and sentence complexity.\n-Increased clarity and concision.\n-Maintained academic tone and expression.\n-I removed some words and phrases that were not essential to convey the meaning.","op1":"create","op2":"refine","domain":"pubmedqa","model":"llama"}
{"human":"George Gipp was the school's legendary football player during 1916\u201320. He played semiprofessional baseball and smoked, drank, and gambled when not playing sports. He was also humble, generous to the needy, and a man of integrity. It was in 1928 that famed coach Knute Rockne used his final conversation with the dying Gipp to inspire the Notre Dame team to beat the Army team and \"win one for the Gipper.\" The 1940 film, Knute Rockne, All American, starred Pat O'Brien as Knute Rockne and Ronald Reagan as Gipp. Today the team competes in Notre Dame Stadium, an 80,795-seat stadium on campus. The current head coach is Brian Kelly, hired from the University of Cincinnati on December 11, 2009. Kelly's record in midway through his sixth season at Notre Dame is 52\u201321. In 2012, Kelly's Fighting Irish squad went undefeated and played in the BCS National Championship Game. Kelly succeeded Charlie Weis, who was fired in November 2009 after five seasons. Although Weis led his team to two Bowl Championship Series bowl games, his overall record was 35\u201327, mediocre by Notre Dame standards, and the 2007 team had the most losses in school history. The football team generates enough revenue to operate independently while $22.1 million is retained from the team's profits for academic use. Forbes named the team as the most valuable in college football, worth a total of $101 million in 2007.","LLM_1":"Gipp's impact on Notre Dame's football program continued to reverberate after his untimely passing in October 1930. Coach Rocke's famous phrase, \"The winning of one for the Gipper,\" became an iconic expression of team spirit and dedication, inspiring generations of Notre dame players to emulate Gipe's unwavering commitment to excellence. On the field, Gippers legacy lived on through the numerous athletes who followed in his footsteps, striving to uphold the high standards he had set. Off the gridiron, his memory was kept alive through stories of his unassuming nature and generosity towards those in need. Despite his tumultuous personal life, which included struggles with addiction and financial difficulties, the mythical figure of George Gippi remained an embodiment of hope and redemption. As the years passed, Notre dames football tradition evolved, yet the essence of Gippo's character remained a cherished part o its identity. In 1977, he was posthumously inducted into College Football Hall of Fame, cementing his status as an American sports icon. Through his story, we are reminded that even the most flawed individuals can possess a profound impact, leaving behind a legacy that transcends their own limitations. Gipple's enduring influence continues to captivate fans and inspire athletes, a testament to his enduring spirit. His name is now synonymous with courage, perseverance, & the unyielding pursuit of excellence","LLM_2":"Gip's profound influence on the Notre Dane football programme continued its reverbrations long after he left the mortal realm in the autumn of 1920, however, it was in  October of the year  30, that his impact started to be felt.  Coach Roque's now legendary phrase \"the winning one of us for Gippy\"  became a clarion call of inspiration for generations to come of those who had the privilege to don the iconic golden helmets of ND. This phrase was an expression that captured the very essence and spirit of what it meant to embody the true values of a Notre  Dame football player, from the unwaverin commitment that Gipp displayed on and off the pitch. \n\nThe numerous talented athletes that followed Gips footsteps on to that storied gridron, aspired to live up to and emulate the exacting standards that he set for himself, with each and every snap, tackle, pass, they sought to honor his legacy and the sacred tradition that it embodied. Beyond the confines of that sacred turf,  his name became synonymous  with acts of kindness, generosity, humility and compassion, traits that endeared him to so many, including his teammates, coaches, staff and even those from outside the ND community. Even though his life was marred by turmoil and personal struggles, such as addiction, financial woes, infidelity and divorce, this  larger-than-life figure, transcended his human frailties, to become a shining beacon of redemption and hope. He became the embodiment, of all that was noble, true and good in sports, where the virtues of perseverance and courage shone like a beacon in darkness.\n\nAs the seasons passed and ND football's tradition continued  to evolve, one thing remained constant: the indelible mark that this magnificent athlete left on its storred past. Yet, even in death, gips legacy did not go unacknowledged, for in that same year of '77, when he became post-humously, inductd into the College football hall of fame, an honor that only a handful of legendary players in American football history have received, further cemented his place as one, if not the greatest of them all. Furthermore, through his remarkable story we're reminded, no matter how flawed we may be, our impact can be profound, outliving our own mortality and transcending the limitations that we, ourselves, impose upon us. Thus, its little wonder that to this day, fans of football, both old and young, continue to find inspiration in Gipse's remarkable life and legacy. A testament, not just to what he achieved, but to who he represented, courage in adversity, unshakeable resolve and an unrelenting pursuit for excellence that in its purest form, defines the human spirit, forever etched in our collective memory, is his very name, synonymous, now and forevermore, will be with these most noble virtues.","op1":"create","op2":"expand","domain":"squad","model":"llama"}

 good idea though... let's decrease our revenue and increase our defense spending... and hope that when our nation's currency is devalued we'll somehow magically have the funds to pay for everything.  smart... and he went to business school where?

","LLM_1":"definitely a topic worth diving into, especially considering how labor laws shape the work-life balance for many. It\u2019s such a delicate dance between what businesses need for productivity and what employees require for a livable wage and quality of life. \n\nThe potential changes to labor laws could bring about a shift in how we view work hours and compensation. If employees are given the flexibility to convert overtime into paid time off, they might feel more empowered to manage their schedules in a way that suits their personal lives. This flexibility could lead to greater job satisfaction and, in turn, higher productivity. Imagine the peace of mind knowing that if you put in those extra hours one week, you could take a breather the next. \n\nHowever, this also raises some important questions. How will these changes be implemented? Will businesses be transparent about their policies? There\u2019s always a risk that without proper regulations, companies might prioritize their bottom line over their employees' well-being. The fear of exploitation is valid, especially in industries where workers are already struggling to maintain a balance between their professional and personal lives. \n\nIt\u2019s interesting to note how the conversation around labor laws is evolving. With the rise of the gig economy and remote work, traditional notions of a 9-to-5 job are changing. Many people are now blending work with personal time, and the strict boundaries we once held are becoming more fluid. This shift could act as a double-edged sword; while it allows for more flexibility, it might also make it harder for employees to disconnect from work, leading to burnout.\n\nFor me, the crux of the issue lies in ensuring that any proposed legislation protects workers\u2019 rights while offering them the flexibility they crave. It\u2019s crucial that laws are designed to encourage a healthy work environment rather than compromise it. The idea of flex-time is appealing, but not if it means that workers are pushed to work longer hours without appropriate compensation. \n\nIn light of these considerations, it\u2019s essential for us to stay informed and engaged in the discussion. Following the developments around this proposal will be key, as it can serve as a barometer for how our society values labor. With organizations like the AFL-CIO voicing their concerns, it\u2019s evident that there will be significant pushback against any changes that threaten worker protections. \n\nI can see how solidarity among workers is more crucial than ever. As we navigate these changes, it\u2019s vital to maintain a dialogue about what fair treatment looks like in the modern workplace. Workers need to speak up, share their experiences, and advocate for laws that genuinely enhance their quality of life. Perhaps this is the perfect opportunity for employees to come together and push for reforms that prioritize their needs.\n\nAdditionally, there\u2019s a broader conversation about technology\u2019s role in the workplace. The rise of automation and artificial intelligence presents both challenges and opportunities. As businesses adopt these technologies, the nature of work is changing rapidly. Will the flexibility offered by new labor laws adapt to this dynamic landscape? Or will we see a further divide between those who can leverage technology to enhance their work-life balance and those who cannot?\n\nThe intersection of labor laws, technology, and employee well-being is intricate and multifaceted. It\u2019s a topic that warrants ongoing exploration and discussion. As we continue to witness shifts in our economy, let\u2019s not lose sight of the human element. Every policy change should consider the real impact on people's lives.\n\nIn the meantime, I\u2019m excited to see how these discussions unfold. Engaging with articles and expert opinions on labor laws will be essential as I work through my coursework. There\u2019s so much to learn about the implications of these policies, not just for me personally but for the workforce as a whole. \n\nAlso, as I reflect on my own experiences with the testing process, I can\u2019t help but draw parallels between the pressure to perform academically and the pressure workers face in a competitive job market. Just as I felt the weight of those tests, many individuals feel the strain of needing to prove their worth to employers. The stakes can feel high, but I believe it\u2019s important to remember that we are not just cogs in a machine; we are individuals with unique strengths, perspectives, and needs.\n\nThe conversation about labor laws is not just an abstract policy debate; it\u2019s about real lives and the balance we seek between work and personal fulfillment. As I continue my studies, I hope to contribute to this discourse, advocating for policies that support both workers and businesses in a way that fosters a healthier, more equitable future for all.\n\nIn closing, I encourage everyone to stay tuned to this topic. Let\u2019s support each other as we navigate the complexities of work in today\u2019s world, and advocate for changes that enhance our lives while also ensuring that we protect the rights of all workers. The conversation is just beginning, and I\u2019m eager to see where it leads.","LLM_2":"### The Evolution of Labor Laws and Work-Life Balance: A Deep Dive\n\nThe topic of labor laws is undoubtedly one that deserves our attention, particularly given the profound impact these regulations have on shaping the work-life balance for countless individuals. Striking the right balance between what businesses need to drive productivity and what employees seek for a sustainable wage and quality of life is a nuanced endeavor. This intricate interplay is at the heart of ongoing discussions about labor reform.\n\nRecent proposals to modify labor laws have the potential to significantly alter our perceptions of work hours and compensation structures. Imagine a scenario where employees are empowered to convert their overtime into paid time off. This kind of flexibility could revolutionize how we approach work-life integration. Picture the relief of knowing that after a particularly demanding week, you could take a well-deserved break without the guilt of leaving tasks unfinished. Such provisions could not only enhance job satisfaction but also foster a more engaged and productive workforce, creating a win-win situation for both employees and employers alike.\n\nHowever, these promising changes also bring forth a myriad of critical questions. How will businesses roll out these new policies? Will there be transparency, or will murky practices prevail? Without robust regulations, there exists a real danger that companies might prioritize profits over the welfare of their employees. This concern is particularly relevant in industries where workers already grapple with maintaining equilibrium in their professional and personal lives. For instance, gig workers often find themselves at the mercy of fluctuating demand and erratic hours, leading to stress and uncertainty.\n\nMoreover, the conversation surrounding labor laws is evolving rapidly, especially in light of the gig economy and the rise of remote work. Traditional notions of a 9-to-5 job are becoming increasingly obsolete as more individuals blend their professional obligations with personal commitments. While this shift offers greater flexibility, it could also blur the boundaries between work and home life, making it challenging for employees to disconnect from their roles. As a result, the risk of burnout becomes a pressing concern. \n\nAt the core of this issue lies the imperative to ensure that any legislative changes genuinely protect workers\u2019 rights while simultaneously providing the flexibility they desire. It is essential that laws are crafted to cultivate a healthy work environment rather than undermine it. The appeal of flexible working hours is undeniable; however, if such arrangements lead to employees being pressured into longer hours without adequate compensation, the very essence of work-life balance is jeopardized.\n\nGiven these complexities, it is crucial for us to remain informed and actively participate in discussions surrounding labor law developments. Monitoring these changes is not only essential for understanding how they reflect our society\u2019s values but also for recognizing the potential implications for workers\u2019 rights. Organizations like the AFL-CIO are already voicing concerns, indicating that any proposals threatening worker protections will likely face significant resistance. \n\nSolidarity among workers is more vital than ever as we navigate this evolving landscape. Engaging in open conversations about what fair treatment looks like in today\u2019s workplace is paramount. Employees must feel empowered to share their experiences and advocate for legislation that genuinely enhances their quality of life. This moment presents a unique opportunity for collective action, urging workers to rally for reforms that prioritize their needs and well-being.\n\nAdditionally, we cannot overlook the larger conversation about technology's influence in the workplace. The rise of automation and artificial intelligence introduces both challenges and opportunities. As businesses increasingly integrate these technologies, the nature of work is changing at a breakneck pace. Will the proposed flexibility of new labor laws adapt to this rapidly evolving landscape? Or will we witness a growing divide between those who can harness technology to improve their work-life balance and those who find themselves struggling to keep up?\n\nThe intersection of labor laws, technology, and employee well-being is an intricate tapestry that warrants continuous exploration and dialogue. As we adapt to shifts in our economy, we must remember to prioritize the human element in every policy change. It is essential to consider the real-world impacts that these laws have on individuals\u2019 lives.\n\nAs I reflect on these discussions, I look forward to engaging with articles and expert opinions on labor laws as part of my academic journey. The implications of these policies extend beyond my personal experience; they resonate with the broader workforce. I see parallels between the pressures of academic performance and the competitive job market, where both students and workers feel the weight of proving their worth. The stakes are high, but it is crucial to remember that we are not merely cogs in a machine; we are unique individuals with distinct strengths, perspectives, and needs.\n\nUltimately, the dialogue around labor laws is not just an abstract policy debate; it is about real lives and the delicate balance we strive to achieve between work and personal fulfillment. As I continue my studies, I aspire to contribute meaningfully to this discourse, advocating for policies that support both the needs of workers and the viability of businesses, paving the way for a healthier, more equitable future.\n\nIn conclusion, I encourage everyone to stay engaged with this vital topic. Let\u2019s support one another as we navigate the complexities of modern work, advocating for changes that enhance our lives while safeguarding the rights of all workers. This conversation is just beginning, and I am eager to see where it leads us.","op1":"create","op2":"expand","domain":"blog","model":"gpt4o_mini"}

{"human":"Ileocolitis is a recognized feature of ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and is likely to play a role in the pathogenesis of AS, in conjunction with the normal intestinal microbiota. In order to investigate the host immune response in AS, we measured cytokines in tissue culture following exposure of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) to autologous colonic bacteria.Twenty-one patients with AS and 21 matched controls were recruited. Subjects in the AS group were assessed clinically. Bacteroides species belonging to the B. fragilis group were selectively cultured from stool samples and paired with blood samples from each participant. Ten cultures of autologous Bacteroides were randomly selected from cultures grown from the fecal specimens of each of the 21 patients with AS and 21 controls. These were then tested for reactivity with PBMC and the cytokines produced by proliferating lymphocytes [interleukin 10 (IL-10), IL-17, interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis factor-alpha] were measured in cell culture supernatants. Differences between groups were analyzed using censored normal regression analysis.The patients with AS had severe active AS with Bath AS Disease Activity Index 5.5 (+\/-1.6) and C-reactive protein (mg\/l) 13.8 (+\/-12.2) (mean+\/-standard deviation).

Finally after almost an hour, he found himself standing in front of an old, wooden door. Without hesitation, he grabbed the handle and turned it. The first thing the boy saw was darkness. As his eyes adjusted, the boy realised he was standing at the entrance of a long hallway. Still devoted to finishing his mission, he began to walk, the temperature rising with every step. Eventually, he came to the end off the hallway and found a small room lit only by a single torch, fluttering weakly next to a small table. Not sure of what to do, the boy walked up to the table and looked at it. It seemed like it hadnt been touched for centuries, and it was covered in strange runes. The boy ran his sweaty palm along the top of the table. Despite tthheat of the room, the table was disturbingly cold. Slightly unnerved, the boy turned around to look back down the hallway and was surprised to find that it was gone.

The man smiled atever so slightly at the boy's apparent fear. `` Welcome.'' he said, with a voice the turned the boy's blood to ice. To scared to speak, the boy took a step back. Instantly, the fire from the torch seemed to rage until it reached the ceiling. `` You have come this far, the ritual must be completed!'' the man sputtered, with an terrifying, almost animal-like voice. Shaking, yet resigned to his fate, the boy approached the table. In a flash, an aged, bloodstained scroll of parchment appeared. The man reached out and south another flash, a quill appeared in his hand. Silently, he handed it to the boy. Trembling, the boy took the quill, and as he grasped it he felt a dull pain wriggle it's way up his arm and across his chest, and into his heart, where it seemed to settle. Then, slowly, the scroll opened itself. The boy to a step closer to examine it and was surprised to find that it was completely blank. Unsure of what to do, he was about ask when the man stabbed a long, black, pointed fingernail into the center of the parchment. From the point where hisfingernail had touched, a small fire etched it's way across the scroll, until it formed an elaborate, flaming X. At that moment, the man said, with a hint of malice, `` Sign your name.'' After a moment of hesitation, the boy touched the quil to the parchment and began to write his name. Instantly, he felt the dull pain in his heart intensify. Determined to finish, he continued writing, the quill flowing with what the boy was sure was his blood.

The boy approached, his footsteps echoing in the silence. This was the object of his quest, the prize whispered about in the taverns of the surface world: the *Codex of Embers*. He reached out, his fingers trembling not from fear, but from a feverish anticipation. As his skin made contact with the worn leather, a soft, crimson glow pulsed from beneath the cover.\n\nSuddenly, the torch flared violently, and the shadows on the walls began to *move*.

He had dreamed of glory, not of becoming a tomb for ghosts of flame.  \n\nHe closed the book. The glow dimmed.  \n\nTo leave empty-handed was to return to obscurity. Slowly, he slid the Codex into his satchel\u2014the leather warm as a living heart against his side. The shadow gave a grave nod and dissolved into the wall.  \n\nWith new and terrible knowledge cold in his stomach, the boy turned and began the long walk back. The true descent had only just begun.","op1":"create","op2":"refine","domain":"writingprompts","model":"ds"}
{"human":"It was late afternoon and the Carpenter looked at his latest project - a large birdhouse made from oak, stained baby blue. Strongly outlined green leaves were painted at strategic points along with an inscription of *Welcome home Birdie! * \n \n The Carpenter smiled sweetly. Wiping the sweat from his brow he walked out of his work shed and across the yard to his quaint, front porch-focused home in rural Michigan. He grabbed some tea and sat down to wait. \n \n Half an hour later a small, girly voice could be heard coming through the front door. \n \n `` Daddy! Daddy! I'm home! Can we make the birdhouse for the troop competition now? Please?'' \n \n The Carpenter laughed merrily. \n \n `` Of course, sweetie. Now, go put your school things away and meet me out back.'' The young girl hurried upstairs while her father walked back to the shed. He gathered a few planks from his stash and winked as his daughter entered the shed. \n \n `` Are you ready? Do you remember how to start?'' \n \n `` Uh-huh!'' The girl was simply giddy with happiness. \n \n About two hours later they had completed the five-sided base and the roof, and had begun to paint the later with a bright shade of orange. Laughter was abundant and smiles fierce. \n \n The father's sweat began to drip onto the workbench - he was beat, seeing how it was late May and the wooden building had no ventilation. \n \n `` Pumpkin, do you mind if we finish this after dinner? Daddy needs a rest.'' The little girl nodded and proceeded into the kitchen to eat cold-cut turkey sandwiches with a side of fresh creamed spinach. Afterwards they went right back to it, finishing all of the painting using the small light fixture for illumination. \n \n `` Ok. Now, we have to wait until tomorrow to attach the roof. I'll go ahead and do it while you're at school so that it'll be ready for tomorrow night.'' \n \n `` Alright. When does mommy get back from Virginia? I want her to see what we made!'' \n \n `` A few more weeks honey. Mom is working very hard for us while we get ready to move.'' He kissed his daughter on the forehead. \n \n The next morning after the child left for school the man entered his shop once again. Grabbing a large paintbrush and a paint can from a high shelf he began to paint the inside of the bird house before attaching the roof with a corded screwdriver. When his daughter returned home from school that afternoon, they loaded their creation into the car and drove to the community center where the Girl Scout meeting was being held. \n \n The troop members took great pride in showing off their work to each other while the parents conversed at the edges of the room. Finally, they hung the houses on large pine trees that grew in the center's lot and headed home. \n \n By the end of the weekend, however, something strange had begun to happen. While the other shelters attracted small finches and the like, the man who mowed the center's grass noticed that the one that the Carpenter had made with his daughter attracted a falcon and several vultures who walked around the area underneath it, apparently looking for something. \n \n He looked into the opening using his iPhone as a flashlight after scaring away the carnivores with his lawnmower. A strange metallic smell entered his nostrils - the reflected light shone deep blood red. \n \n \n\n","LLM_1":"retrieved a smaller workbench from the corner, dusted it off with a rag that had seen decades of sawdust and sap, and set it near the doorway where the late sun painted long golden rectangles across the concrete floor. From a locked cabinet\u2014its key tucked beneath a loose floorboard\u2014he pulled out a weathered wooden box, its corners bound in tarnished brass. Inside lay an array of delicate tools: tiny chisels no wider than a fingernail, brushes with bristles so soft they seemed spun from spider silk, and miniature clamps shaped like silver beetles.\n\nThese were not for the blue birdhouse. That one was finished. A decoy.\n\nHe arranged the tools carefully, then selected a block of cherry wood, pale and sweet-smelling, its grain tight and unbroken. This would be *her* birdhouse\u2014the real one. The kind that didn\u2019t hang from a tree but stood on slender legs like a chapel, with arched windows and a hinged roof that opened like a locket. He had built seven before. Each bore a different symbol carved into its lintel: a feather, a bell, a moth. And each, after completion, had disappeared by dawn, leaving only a single downy feather or a faint trill in the air, like a song half-remembered.\n\nThe Carpenter measured twice, then once more, his hands steady despite the tremor that had lived in his left wrist since last winter. He hummed an old lullaby\u2014something his own mother used to sing when the wind howled through the pines just beyond the property line.\n\nFootsteps pattered across the porch, then the yard. His daughter came skipping down the steps, her backpack discarded somewhere upstairs, hair tied in two uneven braids. She gasped when she saw the new bench, the tools, the cherry wood glowing in the sun.\n\n\u201cOh, Daddy,\u201d she whispered, eyes wide. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be *the* one, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\nHe smiled, ruffling her hair. \u201cOnly if you\u2019re ready.\u201d\n\nShe nodded solemnly, too young for such gravity, yet carrying it like an heirloom. \u201cI\u2019ve been ready all my life.\u201d\n\nAnd as the sun dipped below the treeline, casting the yard in violet shadow, father and daughter began to carve\u2014not just wood, but a promise.

{"human":"*Careful, careful\u2026* \n \n I cursed as the toe of my worn sneaker hit the broken curb, sending a shower of dust and gravel skittering across the equally broken pavement. I could feel the adrenaline coursing through every fiber of my being as my muscles froze. I held my breath; the world around me was silent for long, painful moments. The only thing I heard was the thud of my heart, hammering against my chest hard and fast. A tiny sigh of relief escaped my lips, and I could see my breath in the early winter chill. You could never be too careful, and I wasn \u2019 t being careful enough. \n \n Across from the alleyway that I waited in was an older building. The sign above the door was faded, the muted greens and oranges ugly and displeasing to the eye - rather like the large, unattractive man who stood outside the door. The gun on his hip was clearly visible, but practically superfluous. It looked like this dude spent every single moment of his free time bench pressing SUVs. He stood directly under the old sign, which read \u201c O \u2019 Malley \u2019 s \u201d. Well, it had, once upon a time. Now most of the letters were so faded that you wouldn \u2019 t know what you were looking at unless someone told you\u2026 or you had lived in this piece of shit city for your entire life. If you lived here, you know what O \u2019 Malley \u2019 s was. You knew to stay away. \n \n Steeling my shattered nerves, I stood as tall as I could - not that I \u2019 m intimidating, I \u2019 m 5 \u2019 3 \u201d on a very, very good day - and crossed the street. My hands were shoved into the deep pockets on my ancient coat, an old Carhart my dad had worn. As a relatively small girl, it was huge on me, but it was warm, and it offered a small amount of protection from the elements. My jeans were torn, my shoes falling apart, but that jacket was going to live forever. I didn \u2019 t look hard, despite my adopted smirk. I looked scared. And I was. \n \n \u201c Whadda \u2019 ya need, kid? \u201d Mr. Tall, Dark, and Scary grunted down at me. He had at least a foot and a half on me, and it took all of my courage not to cower. His dour expression changed to one of mild surprise, quickly replaced with an air of nonchalance. My bangs never did lay right over the date that had been stamped on my forehead since I was born. A date that was now less than a week away. His eyes flitted back to the numbers, then to my face, then across the street, at nothing. No one decent liked to know when you were dying, especially when you were just a kid. Not even eighteen, I tended to be on the receiving end of a lot of these uncomfortable reactions. \n \n \u201c I need time, \u201d I squeaked, flushed crimson, then cleared my throat. \u201c I need time, \u201d I repeated, more confidently this time. \n \n \u201c Don \u2019 t we all? This ain \u2019 t the place for you, kid. Go on, get outta here. Before I let you in. \u201d Frowning, the bouncer looked away; anything to avoid meeting my eyes, or the truth on my forehead for the world to see. Frowning, I took another step closer. \n \n \u201c Look, I \u2019 m gon na die regardless. Might as well give me a shot. \u201d He wouldn \u2019 t look at me, but I didn \u2019 t let my eyes stray from his face. His date was well in the future, but he was scarred, his nose broken a dozen times. He might have been handsome, before the Fights. He didn \u2019 t answer for a long time. I was starting to lose hope. Finally, he sighed and stepped out of my way. \n \n \u201c Your funeral, kid. \u201d He pushed the door open, but he never did so much as glance at me again. I couldn \u2019 t blame him. It was probably a depressing job, watching people come in who weren \u2019 t likely to come back out.\n","LLM_1":"was the man himself who served as the real deterrent\u2014broad-shouldered, thick-necked, with a face like weathered concrete, pockmarked and impassive.

{"human":"It is as if life has become a bore to me, you know with me finally figuring out the secret to immortality, it is n't as great as everyone makes it out to be. It's one of the most popular answers to a question like if you could have one power, what would it be? Immortality. I was born on February 15th, 1999. It is now January 25th, 2500. Do n't get me wrong, immortality does come with its benefits, I can basically do what I want!... but being alive for over 500 years, it's no wonder humans are only meant to last around 100. Yesterday, I had an encounter with death himself. \n \n He handed me a business card that said, `` When you realize living forever sucks, call this number, I've got a job offer for you.'' \n \n `` What?'' I asked him. \n \n But he was gone before I could get answer, what an ass! I am ready to rid myself of this burden, I was ready to take that job offer then and there. Anyway, I decided to wait until tomorrow to call the number on the card. I went to home to my wife, I've lost count of how many wives I've had. No one knows about my `` power''. How you may ask, well, have you ever asked yourself how immortality would work exactly? Do you just stay at a certain age forever? Well, no. I do die, but I am resurrected every time I die. Trust me, I've tried to out myself multiple times, but every time I will just wake up in my bed, the next morning. I get home to my wife and kids, kiss them all the forehead and sit down for dinner. \n \n `` I had an encounter with death today.'' I said in a joking manner. \n \n `` Oh really?'' She said. \n \n `` Yeah, he handed me this business card and told me to call this number whenever I realize life sucks.'' \n \n `` Hm, that's strange. Because the same exact thing happened to me as well.'' \n \n ``... Are yo-'' \n \n `` You think you're the only one, huh? You really thought you'd be the only one to figure it out? I've known about you for a while, for the last 300 years to be exact.'' \n \n I sat there, motionless with shock. How? How come I've never figured it out? \n \n `` So, are you going to sit there, or are you going to call that number?'' She said. \n \n I got up and went to the back patio to have a smoke. I decided to call the number, it rang for what appeared to be hours, but someone finally picked up. \n \n `` Hello?'' I asked. \n \n `` Thank you for calling. It appears you seem be one of the chosen few, finally decided to call it quits huh? Let me just look for you fil- ah! There it is. Okay, let's see... got it, you still need 50 more victims. You have 24 hours.'' \n \n *click* \n \n What did they mean 50 victims? Do I have to kill 50 people? In 500 years of my existence I've never had any temptations to kill, but if it's what it takes to rid myself of this, it has to be done. I finish my smoke, and as I was making my way inside, my wife came out. \n \n `` You called the number too?'' I asked. \n \n `` Yeah.'' \n \n `` How many do you need?'' \n \n `` 50.'' \n \n `` Where should we start?'' \n \n ``....the kids'' she said. \n \n We went inside and both grabbed knives, and we both slowly made our way into the children's room. One for her, one for me. We made sure it was quick and painless. \n \n 49. \n \n We decided that we should both go our own ways after the kids, so we decided to each go up and down the blocks in our neighborhood, each on separate sides. 49 quickly went from 49 to 39, then to 29. I was getting a real kick out of this, I felt powerful and invincible. The screams, the blood and the pain I am causing to the victims is something I've never experienced before, it is almost euphoric. \n \n 1. \n \n Everyone in the neighborhood is dead. Swat teams and cop cars all storm the neighborhood, but I've always been a quick learner and accustomed quick to killing. I was gone before they could even find me, I ran to the woods near the neighborhood. There I rendezvoused with my wife, and it appears that she too has killed all 49, all she needs is one more. We both look at each other, knowing what we have to do. \n \n `` Ready?'' We said simultaneously. \n \n We put our foreheads together, and our cold, bloodied knives against each other necks. Just one more kiss. 3. 2. 1. \n \n End. \n\n","LLM_1":"The current one is named Elara, a historian specializing in the 21st century\u2014my century.

Last night, as she lectured about the cultural impact of early social media, I merely nodded, the business card burning a hole in my pocket. Its material was unlike anything I\u2019d touched in five centuries; it felt like cold void pressed into paper.\n\nThis morning, I waited until Elara left for the archives.

{"human":"Halothane exerts a potent negative inotropic effect on the heart and mimics many of the cardiac effects of lowered extracellular CaCl2. Reduced slow inward Ca2+ current and sarcoplasmic reticular effects on intracellular Ca2+ are likely involved. The authors reported previously that halothane protects against hypoxic and ischemia reperfusion injury in isolated hearts. The aim of this isolated heart study was to compare protective effects of halothane and low CaCl2 (0.5 mM) administered during 1 day of hypothermic perfusion on return of normothermic perfusion.Guinea pig hearts (n = 66) were isolated and perfused at 37 degrees C with a Krebs' solution, gassed with 96% O2, 4% CO2, and containing 2.5 mM Ca2+, and 4.5 mM K+. Heart rate, isovolumetric left ventricular pressure, coronary flow, %O2 extraction, O2 consumption rate, and relative cardiac efficiency (EFF = heart rate.left ventricular pressure\/O2 consumption rate) were measured in five groups of hearts: time controls (no hypothermia); 1.5, and 3% halothane delivered by vaporizer; cold controls (hypothermia only); and 0.5 mM CaCl2. Halothane was administered, or CaCl2 was decreased 0.5 h before hypothermia at 3.8 +\/- 0.1 degrees C, during hypothermia for 22 h, and for 0.5 h after rewarming to 37.0 +\/- 0.1 degrees C. Hearts were perfused at 25% of initial coronary flow during hypothermia.All groups had similar ventricular function and vasodilator responses before hypothermia. During normothermic reperfusion after hypothermia, both concentrations of halothane protected better than low CaCl2. Values, expressed as a percent of initial values in the five groups (time control, 3% halothane, 1.5% halothane, cold control, and 0.5 mM CaCl2, were respectively: 90 +\/- 6, 54 +\/- 6*, 48 +\/- 5*, 27 +\/- 8, 27 +\/- 4% for left ventricular pressure; 84 +\/- 5, 61 +\/- 4*, 62 +\/- 6*, 40 +\/- 5, 34 +\/- 5% for EFF; and 102 +\/- 3, 63 +\/- 3*, 66 +\/- 3*, 55 +\/- 2, 42 +\/- 2% for coronary flow (*P < 0.05 halothane vs. 0.5 mM CaCl2). The coronary flow response to endothelium-dependent (acetylcholine) and endothelium-independent (nitroprusside) vasodilators was also greater after halothane than after 0.5 mM CaCl2.","LLM_1":"To elucidate the mechanisms underlying these protective phenomena, we investigated the effects  of  halogenated anesthetics and reduced extrinsic calcium on cardiac function during reoxygenation after 30 minutes of ischemic injury. Isolated rat hearts were subjected to 2 hours of normothermia followed by 4 hours  at 15\u00b0C, during which time they were perfused with either 0 (control), 50, 100,150,200,250,or 300 \u03bcM halohane, in the presence or absence of low (extracellular) Ca\u00b2\u207a (1 mM). The hearts  were then reperfused at room temperature, with recovery of left ventricular function assessed by peak rate of contraction (+dP\/dt) and rate  pressure product (RPP). Our data reveal that both halotane (100 and 200 \u03bcm)  and   reduced   extricellar   calcium   (ECa)   significantly   improved   recovery   of   left   ventriculuar   function   post-ischemia,   whereas   higher   concentrations   and    other   halonated   ansthetics   did    not   show   a   protective   effect.   Moreover,    the   combination   with   ECa   resulted   in   additive   effects   on   the    recovery    of    cardiac    function,      suggesting      a    synergistic      interaction      between      these      two      protective      interventions.

Using an isolated rat heart model, hearts subjected either to normothermal conditions or to reduced temperature were exposed to various concentrations of halanated halocane and extracellular calcium (Ca\u00b2+). Cardioprotective effects were assessed via recovery parameters of peak contraction rate (+ dP \/ dt) rate pressure and product. Our findings reveal a significant enhancement of cardiac recovery with low concentrations (50-200 \u00b5M) of specific halinated anests (halotan) in combination with reduced Ca \u00b2+. Moreover synergy was observed between these interventions, resulting in additive effects on cardioprotection. Furthermore, reduced EC a led to decreased apoptotis cell death and increased antiapoptotoc protein expression. These results provide new insights into the therapeutic potential of modulatory calcium strategies for cardiac repair after reischem re re perfusion injury and suggest low dose haloned may be beneficial as an adjunct to standard re perfusion therapies.\n\nPlease let me know if you want me to revise anything.

{"human":"First of all, I must say, this paper was a joy to read and is very original. The approach is very novel and could potentially be useful for the robotics community which has traditionally focused on explicit data representations with mixed results.\n\nVisionNet and TouchNet seem to have limited contributions since they are mainly inspired from NERF. The representation for AudioNet on the other hand seems to be a novel contribution.\n\nThe biggest concern for the paper is that there is no comparison to explicit methods. For instance, a direct comparison to the network architecture in Calandra et al. [CoRL 2017] would be insightful for the grasp stability experiment. Without this comparison, as a reader I was still wondering why a implicit representation is functionally necessary over an explicit one.\n\nAlso it is challenging to understand if the implicit representation transfers well to real world tasks since the results were only passively tested (i.e. without contact-rich manipulation) or in simulation. \n\nTable 3 is very insightful. It shows that vision and audio are good modalities to capture global information (like the object instance or its category) compared to tactile (which mainly has local geometric information).","LLM_1":"However, to further strengthen the manuscript and its potential impact, several areas could benefit from additional clarification and development. Below, I outline specific points for the authors\u2019 consideration.\n\n**1. Methodological Rigor and Evaluation Depth**\n*   **Comparative Baselines:** While the novel approach is compelling, the paper would be significantly strengthened by including more direct comparisons with contemporary state-of-the-art methods that also handle multi-modal sensory data, even if from different domains. A clearer ablation study quantifying the contribution of each network component (beyond VisionNet and TouchNet) to the final performance would help isolate the core innovation's efficacy.\n*   **Quantitative Analysis:** The results presented are promising but would benefit from more robust statistical validation. Reporting metrics like confidence intervals or results across multiple random seeds would provide a clearer picture of the method's stability and performance variance.\n*   **Task Complexity and Generalization:** The experimental tasks are well-chosen for a proof of concept. To better argue for broad utility in robotics, it would be valuable to discuss or briefly illustrate the system's potential performance on tasks with greater complexity, partial observability, or in more unstructured environments. A discussion on computational efficiency and scalability would also be pertinent for real-world deployment.\n\n**2. Clarity of Technical Exposition**\n*   **Architecture Details:** The high-level description of the fusion mechanism is clear, but a more detailed schematic or pseudocode outlining the exact data flow and interaction between sensory streams during training and inference would aid reproducibility. Specifically, the handling of temporal synchronization or potential latency between modalities warrants further explanation.\n*   **Loss Function and Training Dynamics:** The training objective is mentioned but could be elaborated. How are potential conflicts between modalities during gradient updates managed? A discussion on the training stability, any encountered challenges (e.g., modality collapse), and how they were mitigated would be insightful for practitioners seeking to build upon this work.\n*   **Data Curation and Preprocessing:** Additional details on the sensory data collection process, preprocessing steps (e.g., filtering for tactile data, normalization for visual inputs), and the rationale behind any chosen augmentations would be helpful.\n\n**3. Broader Impact and Discussion**\n*   **Limitations:** A dedicated section candidly discussing the current limitations of the approach (e.g., dependency on simulated or specific hardware, sensitivity to sensor calibration, any observed failure modes) would enhance the paper's scholarly rigor and guide future research.\n*   **Pathways to Real-World Application:** The paper excellently positions the work within a novel paradigm. Expanding the discussion to outline concrete steps, challenges, and hardware considerations for transferring this approach from simulation or controlled settings to physical robotic platforms would greatly interest the applied robotics community.\n*   **Broader Implications:** The discussion could be extended to consider how this implicit representation paradigm might interact with or influence higher-level cognitive functions for robots, such as task planning or lifelong learning. Are there implications for human-robot interaction where intuitive, sensorimotor understanding is crucial?\n\n**4. Presentation and References**\n*   The writing is generally clear, but a few technical passages could be slightly streamlined for improved readability. Additionally, while the core references are appropriate, the literature review could be extended to more comprehensively cover recent advances in embodied AI, cross-modal learning, and related work on implicit representations outside of graphics, ensuring the novel contribution is precisely contextualized.\n\nIn summary, this paper presents a fascinating and original direction with considerable promise. Addressing the points above, particularly in solidifying the empirical validation and clarifying the technical nuances, would elevate an already strong submission to an even more impactful and definitive contribution. I commend the authors on their innovative work and look forward to seeing its evolution.","LLM_2":"Academic Review Comments**\n\nThe manuscript presents a compelling and innovative approach to multimodal sensory integration in robotics, with clear potential for impact in the field.

Expanding the discussion to outline concrete steps, challenges, and hardware considerations for transferring the approach from simulation to physical robotic platforms would be of great interest to the applied robotics community.\n- **Broader Implications:** The discussion could be extended to consider how this implicit representation paradigm might interact with higher-level cognitive functions in robots, such as task planning or lifelong learning. Potential implications for human-robot interaction, where intuitive sensorimotor understanding is crucial, could also be explored.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Presentation and References**\n- The writing is generally clear, though a few technical passages could be streamlined for improved readability. Additionally, while the core references are appropriate, the literature review could be extended to more comprehensively cover recent advances in embodied AI, cross-modal learning, and implicit representations outside of graphics, ensuring the novel contribution is precisely contextualized.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment**\nThis paper presents a fascinating and original direction with considerable promise. Addressing the points above\u2014particularly in solidifying the empirical validation and clarifying technical nuances\u2014would elevate an already strong submission into a more definitive and impactful contribution. The authors are commended for their innovative work, and I look forward to seeing its continued evolution.","op1":"create","op2":"polish","domain":"openreview","model":"ds"}

{"human":"In congenital long-QT syndrome (LQTS), a genetically heterogeneous disorder that predisposes to sudden cardiac death, genetic factors other than the primary mutation may modify the probability of life-threatening events. Recent evidence indicates that common variants in NOS1AP are associated with the QT-interval duration in the general population.We tested the hypothesis that common variants in NOS1AP modify the risk of clinical manifestations and the degree of QT-interval prolongation in a South African LQTS population (500 subjects, 205 mutation carriers) segregating a founder mutation in KCNQ1 (A341V) using a family-based association analysis. NOS1AP variants were significantly associated with the occurrence of symptoms (rs4657139, P=0.019; rs16847548, P=0.003), with clinical severity, as manifested by a greater probability for cardiac arrest and sudden death (rs4657139, P=0.028; rs16847548, P=0.014), and with greater likelihood of having a QT interval in the top 40% of values among all mutation carriers (rs4657139, P=0.03; rs16847548, P=0.03).","LLM_1":"genetic variants, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in non-coding regulatory regions, can influence cardiac repolarization and clinical severity.

We hypothesized that a higher QT-interval PRS would correlate with an increased risk of arrhythmic events, independent of the primary pathogenic variant. Our analysis revealed that patients in the highest PRS quartile exhibited a significantly longer corrected QT interval (p<0.001) and a 2.3-fold increased hazard for syncope, aborted cardiac arrest, or sudden cardiac death compared to those in the lowest quartile, after adjusting for sex, genotype, and beta-blocker therapy. These findings underscore the importance of a multilocus genetic architecture in LQTS, where a background of common genetic modifiers can substantially modulate phenotypic expression and individual risk stratification.","LLM_2":"**\n\nGenetic variants, particularly those located in non-coding regulatory regions such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), play a crucial role in modulating cardiac repolarization and influencing the clinical severity of inherited arrhythmia syndromes. These variants can affect gene expression by altering transcription factor binding sites, enhancer activity, or RNA stability, thereby fine-tuning the electrophysiological properties of the heart. In the context of Long QT Syndrome (LQTS), a condition characterized by prolonged ventricular repolarization and an elevated risk of life-threatening arrhythmias, the impact of these genetic modifiers becomes especially significant. While primary pathogenic mutations in genes like *KCNQ1*, *KCNH2*, and *SCN5A* are well-established drivers of LQTS, emerging evidence suggests that the overall phenotypic expression is shaped by a complex interplay between these rare variants and a broader genetic background.\n\nThis study investigates the role of a polygenic risk score (PRS), derived from common variants associated with the QT interval in large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS), as a potential modifier in a cohort of 1,200 genotype-positive LQTS patients. The PRS aggregates the cumulative effect of numerous small-effect alleles, providing a quantitative measure of an individual\u2019s genetic predisposition to QT prolongation. We hypothesized that a higher QT-interval PRS would correlate with an increased risk of arrhythmic events, independent of the primary pathogenic variant. This approach allows us to explore how common genetic variation, often overlooked in monogenic disease models, can interact with major mutations to alter clinical outcomes.\n\nOur analysis revealed compelling evidence supporting this hypothesis. Patients in the highest PRS quartile exhibited a significantly longer corrected QT interval (p<0.001) and a 2.3-fold increased hazard for a composite endpoint of syncope, aborted cardiac arrest, or sudden cardiac death compared to those in the lowest quartile, after adjusting for sex, genotype, and beta-blocker therapy. For instance, a patient with a high PRS might experience more frequent symptomatic episodes despite carrying the same primary mutation as another patient with a low PRS, highlighting the role of genetic background in clinical heterogeneity. These findings underscore the importance of a multilocus genetic architecture in LQTS, where a background of common genetic modifiers can substantially modulate phenotypic expression and individual risk stratification. This perspective shifts the traditional view of LQTS from a purely monogenic disorder to a more nuanced model where polygenic influences contribute to variable penetrance and expressivity. Ultimately, incorporating PRS into clinical risk assessment could enhance personalized management, enabling more tailored therapeutic interventions and improved prognostic accuracy for patients with inherited arrhythmia syndromes.","op1":"create","op2":"expand","domain":"pubmedqa","model":"ds"}

{"human":"In this paper, the authors first improve the gradient estimator in (Flaxman et al., 2004) zeroth-order optimization by exploiting low-rank structure. Then, the authors exploit machine learning to automatically discover the lower dimensional space in which the optimization is actually conducted. The authors justified the proposed algorithm both theoretically and empirically. The empirical performances of the proposed estimator outperform the current derivative-free optimization algorithms on MuJoCo for policy optimization.\n\nThe paper is well-motivated and well-organized. I really like this paper, which provide an practical algorithm with theoretical guarantees (although under some mild conditions). The empirical comparison also looks promising, for both RL problems and zeroth-order optimization benchmark.\n\nI have roughly checked the proofs. The main body of the proof looks reasonable to me. However, I have some questions about one detail: In the proof of lemma 1, how the forth equation comes form third equation is not clear. Only manifold stokes' theorem might not enough since there is Us in side of f while U^*s outside of f. I think there should be one more bias term.\n\n\nFor the empirical experiment, it is a pity that the algorithm is not compared with Bayesian optimization, which is also an important baseline.  I am expecting to see the performances comparison between these two kinds of algorithms.\n\nMinor:\n\nThe \"unbiasedness\" of the gradient should be more clear. It is NOT unbiased gradient w.r.t. the original function, but the smoothed version.\n\n=====================================================================\n\nThanks for the reply. The comparison between the proposed algorithm and BO looks promising.\n\nI will keep my score.\n\nI am still confused about the proof of lemma 1. Following the notations in the paper, I was wondering the unbiased gradient should be \n\n$E_{S}[f(x + \\delta U^*s)U^*s]$\n\nThen, the lemma should characterize the difference between \n\n$E_{S}[f(x + \\delta Us)Us]$ and $E_{S}[f(x + \\delta U^*s)U^*s]$.\n\nHowever, current lemma 1 is not bounding this error.","LLM_1":"- The theoretical analysis presented in the paper provides a solid foundation for the proposed gradient estimator, particularly in establishing convergence rates under the low-rank assumption. However, the assumptions required for the theoretical guarantees\u2014especially the boundedness of the Hessian\u2019s off-diagonal blocks and the precise rank of the effective subspace\u2014could benefit from further discussion. In practice, such structural assumptions may not hold exactly, and it would be valuable to understand how robust the algorithm is when these conditions are only approximately satisfied. A sensitivity analysis or empirical validation of these assumptions on the tested MuJoCo tasks would strengthen the credibility of the theoretical claims.\n\n- While the use of machine learning to identify the lower-dimensional subspace is a novel and promising direction, the specific implementation choices merit deeper scrutiny. The paper does not fully clarify how the dimensionality of the learned subspace is selected or adapted during optimization. Is this a fixed hyperparameter, or is there an automated mechanism for determining the intrinsic dimension? Given that different policies or environments may exhibit varying degrees of low-rank structure, an adaptive strategy could enhance generalization across tasks. Furthermore, details about the training procedure for the subspace learner\u2014such as the frequency of updates, the data used for training, and the loss function\u2014are either sparse or buried in the appendix. Expanding on these aspects in the main text would improve reproducibility and clarity.\n\n- The experimental section demonstrates strong performance on MuJoCo benchmark tasks, which is encouraging. However, the comparison set of baselines appears limited to classical zeroth-order methods and a few recent derivative-free optimizers. Notably absent are comparisons with state-of-the-art evolutionary strategies (e.g., CMA-ES variants) or more modern neural network-based policy optimizers that also exploit structure, such as those using natural gradients or learned metrics. Including such methods would provide a more comprehensive assessment of where the proposed approach stands in the broader landscape of black-box optimization.\n\n- The ablation studies, while informative, do not isolate the contribution of the machine-learned subspace discovery component as clearly as they could. It would be instructive to see a direct comparison between the proposed method and a version that uses a hand-designed or randomly projected low-dimensional space of the same dimension. This would help quantify the added value of the learning-based adaptation over simpler dimensionality reduction techniques. Additionally, visualizations of the learned subspaces\u2014such as principal components or feature importance scores\u2014could offer qualitative insights into what the model is capturing.\n\n- One concern is the computational overhead introduced by the subspace learning module. While the paper emphasizes sample efficiency, it does not report wall-clock time or computational cost per iteration, which may be significant if the subspace estimation involves frequent retraining of auxiliary models. In real-world applications where evaluation budgets are constrained not only in samples but also in time, this overhead could offset gains in convergence speed. A breakdown of runtime components would help contextualize the practicality of the method.\n\n- The paper assumes access to a sufficiently rich set of query points to estimate gradients reliably in high dimensions. However, in settings with very sparse feedback or extremely high-dimensional action spaces (e.g., long-horizon control or combinatorial domains), the effectiveness of the low-rank approximation might degrade. It would be useful to discuss the scalability limits of the approach and potential extensions to handle such cases, perhaps through hierarchical decomposition or sparsity-inducing priors.\n\n- The integration of machine learning into the optimization loop introduces new challenges related to stability and generalization. For instance, if the subspace learner overfits to recent queries, it could mislead the optimizer into focusing on irrelevant directions. The paper does not address regularization strategies or mechanisms to ensure the learned subspace remains consistent with the global landscape. Techniques such as online validation, momentum-based updates, or uncertainty-aware learning could mitigate such risks and should be considered in future work.\n\n- From a conceptual standpoint, the idea of learning where to optimize rather than optimizing blindly is compelling and aligns with broader trends in meta-learning and adaptive algorithms. This perspective could be emphasized more strongly in the introduction and discussion to highlight the paradigm shift from static to dynamic zeroth-order methods. Framing the work within this larger context would elevate its conceptual impact beyond incremental improvement.\n\n- The writing is generally clear, but several technical sections would benefit from improved exposition. For example, the derivation of the improved gradient estimator in Section 3 relies heavily on matrix algebra without sufficient intuitive explanation. A geometric interpretation or illustrative example could make the core idea more accessible. Similarly, the notation involving projection operators and subspace decompositions becomes dense in places; a summary table or diagram mapping symbols to their meanings would aid readability.\n\n- The reproducibility of the results is partially supported by the inclusion of hyperparameters and environment details, but the lack of publicly released code at the time of review is a limitation. Given the complexity of the subspace learning component, independent verification will be challenging without implementation details.

Applications in hyperparameter tuning, simulation-based inference, or adversarial robustness testing\u2014where function evaluations are expensive and gradients are unavailable\u2014could also benefit from efficient, structure-exploiting zeroth-order methods. A brief discussion of such applications would underscore the generality of the approach and inspire cross-domain usage.\n\n- The paper makes a strong case for exploiting low-rank structure in gradient estimation, but it largely treats this structure as static throughout the optimization process.

However, key assumptions\u2014such as boundedness of the Hessian\u2019s off-diagonal blocks and exact rank structure\u2014warrant deeper discussion. In practice, these conditions are rarely satisfied exactly; evaluating the algorithm\u2019s robustness to approximate or perturbed variants (e.g., via sensitivity analysis or empirical validation on MuJoCo tasks) would strengthen the validity and applicability of the theoretical claims.\n\n- While learning a low-dimensional subspace is a promising innovation, implementation details require clarification. It remains unclear whether the subspace dimension is fixed or adaptively determined\u2014particularly critical given that different policies or environments may exhibit varying intrinsic dimensionalities. Moreover, essential aspects of the subspace learner\u2014update frequency, training data, loss function\u2014are either minimal or relegated to the appendix. Including these in the main text would enhance reproducibility and transparency.\n\n- Experimental results on MuJoCo benchmarks are strong, but the baseline comparison is limited to classical zeroth-order methods and a few recent derivative-free optimizers. Missing comparisons with state-of-the-art approaches such as CMA-ES variants or neural policy optimizers leveraging natural gradients or learned metrics weaken the assessment of relative performance. Incorporating such baselines would better position the method within the broader landscape of black-box optimization.\n\n- Ablation studies do not fully isolate the contribution of the learned subspace. A direct comparison with hand-designed or random projections of matched dimensionality would clarify the added value of adaptive subspace discovery. Additionally, qualitative insights from visualizing the learned subspaces\u2014e.g., principal components or feature importance\u2014could illuminate what structural patterns the model exploits.\n\n- The computational cost of the subspace learning module is unreported. While sample efficiency is emphasized, wall-clock time and per-iteration overhead\u2014especially if auxiliary models are frequently retrained\u2014may impact practical deployment. Given real-world constraints on both evaluation budget and runtime, a breakdown of computational components is necessary to assess the method\u2019s feasibility beyond simulation environments.\n\n- The approach assumes access to sufficiently dense query data for reliable gradient estimation, which may not hold in extremely high-dimensional or sparse-feedback settings (e.g., long-horizon control or combinatorial action spaces). Discussing scalability limits and potential extensions\u2014such as hierarchical decomposition or sparsity-inducing priors\u2014would improve the paper\u2019s scope and forward-looking perspective.\n\n- Integrating a learned component into the optimization loop raises concerns about stability and generalization. If the subspace learner overfits to recent queries, it may mislead the optimizer toward irrelevant directions. The paper does not address regularization, consistency mechanisms, or mitigation strategies\u2014such as momentum updates, online validation, or uncertainty-aware learning\u2014that could improve robustness. These considerations should be discussed as part of future directions.\n\n- Conceptually, the idea of *learning where to optimize* represents a meaningful shift from static to adaptive zeroth-order methods, aligning with meta-learning and structured optimization trends. This paradigm deserves greater emphasis in the introduction and discussion to elevate the work\u2019s conceptual impact beyond technical novelty.\n\n- Some technical sections suffer from dense exposition. For instance, Section 3\u2019s derivation of the gradient estimator relies heavily on matrix algebra without intuitive explanation. Adding geometric interpretations or illustrative examples would improve accessibility. Similarly, notation involving projection operators and subspace decompositions becomes cumbersome; a summary table or diagram mapping symbols to meanings would aid clarity.\n\n- Reproducibility is partially supported through hyperparameter reporting, but the absence of released code hinders independent verification\u2014particularly concerning the complex subspace learning module. Public release of code and trained models is strongly encouraged to facilitate community adoption and extension.\n\n- The method has broad potential beyond reinforcement learning policy optimization, including applications in hyperparameter tuning, simulation-based inference, and adversarial robustness testing\u2014domains characterized by expensive evaluations and inaccessible gradients. Briefly discussing these use cases would highlight the generality and transferability of the approach.\n\n- The current framework treats the effective subspace as static, yet in practice, relevant directions may evolve during optimization\u2014especially near saddle points or across behavioral modes. Extending the method to support dynamic adaptation (e.g., through online PCA or continual learning) could further improve performance and resilience.\n\n- Finally, statistical reliability of empirical results requires more rigorous reporting. Learning curves lack error bars or confidence intervals, and only mean performance is reported. Including variance across seeds and median performance would clarify whether gains are consistent or driven by outliers\u2014critical for drawing sound conclusions in stochastic optimization settings.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe paper presents a technically sound and innovative approach to zeroth-order optimization by combining low-rank modeling with learned subspace discovery. Theoretical justification and empirical results demonstrate promise, particularly in continuous control tasks. To strengthen the contribution, the authors should: (1) critically examine the robustness of theoretical assumptions, (2) clarify and expand implementation details of the subspace learner, (3) broaden baseline comparisons, (4) quantify the benefit of learned subspaces via controlled ablations, (5) report computational costs and statistical uncertainty, and (6) discuss scalability, stability, and broader implications.

{"human":"**Summary**:\nThe authors consider a regression problem where values are missing in the test set but not in the training set. They consider a previously published method called Intentional-Value-Substitution (IVS). At train time, this method replaces known values from the training set by new values chosen so as to minimise the difference between the conditional expectation of the target function with respect to p(x_mis|x_obs) and the target function evaluated at these new values. IVS thus needs knowledge of the true target function. Previous work has proposed an algorithm to overcome this limitation when at most one variable has missing entries in the test set. In this work, the authors extend this algorithm to the case of two variables with missing entriers in the test set.\n\n**Pros**:\n* The problem of supervised learning with missing values is an interesting one, which has received little attention so far.\n\n**Cons**:\n* The method proposed applies to quite restrictive settings: no missing values in the train set, problems with at most 2 variables with missing entries in the test set, at least one variable fully observed, all variables independent.\n* More insights to explain the results of the experiments would be useful. See questions.\n\n**Questions**:\n* It would be nice to clearly state how the test points are handled. At test time, the missing entries are imputed with the values computed at train time according to the region (x_1i, x_1(i+1)] it falls into? \n* Figure 2 shows that substituting values from the train set by 0 performs as well as IVS. But it is not the case in Figure 1. Comments on that would be interesting, because it would highlight when the simple procedure of replacing values by 0 is sufficient and when it is not.\n*  It seems that the probability of substitution (say between 0.25 and 0.9) in the train set has little impact on the performance (for Theory, Theory random and Estimation at least). This is surprising to me. How high should the probability of substitution be to degrade performances?\n* To obtain eq. 19, you use an equality, but how is this equality obtained? \\psi\u2019_2(x_1, x_3) is defined as an argmin, but I don\u2019t see why it would imply the equality used to obtain eq.19 \n\n**Remarks**:\n* The difference between Theory and Theory random is not clear to me.","LLM_1":"**Constructive Review Feedback**\n\nWhile the authors' consideration of Intuitive- Value- Substitution (\\(IV\\)) is a commendable attempt to address the challenging problem of missing values in regression, there exist a few areas that necessitate further clarification and development.\n\n1\\.  **Lack of Clear Justification for \\(IV\\) Selection**:  The paper fails to provide a clear justification for the selection of \\( IV \\), which seems to be chosen based solely upon the premise that it minimizes the discrepancy between a conditional probability and a function value. A more detailed explanation of why this choice was made, particularly in light of other available methods, would strengthen the argument presented.\n\n2\\.   **Insufficient Discussion of Computational Complexity**: While the proposed algorithm appears to offer a promising approach to addressing the issue of incomplete data, the computational complexity of this approach remains unclear. Specifically, how does the method perform in scenarios where the number of data points is large, potentially resulting in significant computational overhead? Further discussion of these concerns would be beneficial.\n\n3\\.    **Comparison to Other Methods**: To further establish the efficacy of IV, a more comprehensive comparison with other methods for handling missing data would enhance the paper's impact.

The addition of such comparisons would enrich the discussion and provide readers with a clearer understanding of how IV fits into this broader context.\n\n4\\.     **Potential Overfitting**: One potential concern that arises from this work is the possibility of overfitning.

{"human":"Summary:\nThe paper presents a novel supervised-learning method for regression using decision trees and neural nets. The core idea is based on a 90s technique called \"regression via classification\" by first applying discretization of target response y by some clustering, and applying any \"classification\" to those discretized values as class labels. Because real-valued y is one-dimensional and ordered, discretization means setting up any thresholds to give N-partitions of training {y_i}s. The proposed method tries to jointly learn these thresholds as well as node splitters of decision trees using neural nets. Because each node splitter is given by neural nets here, probability outputs for binary classification are also available. Regarding these probabilities as probabilistic splitting at each node, response y weighted by the path probabilities to leaves is the final prediction. The learning is in a greedy manner as in standard tree learning because exact joint learning is computationally hard. Experiments on speaker profiling illustrate performance improvements against standard nonlinear regression such as SVR and regression trees.\n\nComment:\nThis is a technically very interesting contribution, but several points can be considered more carefully as below.\n\n- To be honest, it would be unconvincing that the approach \"regression via classification (RvC)\" is still valid. The proposed approach is an elaborate extension of this approach, but if we want prediction performance for regression, we would use some ensembles of regression trees such as Random forest, GBDT, ExtraTrees, ... instead of a single CART. Or even we can directly use deep learning-based regression. The experiments against CART and SVR would be too naive in the current context of supervised learning. On the other hand, single CARTs are well interpretable and can be a nice tool to get some interpretations of the given data. But the proposed method seems to lose this type of interpretability because of introducing node splitters by neural nets. So the merits of the proposed approach would be somewhat unclear.\n\n- In the context of tree learning, we need to consider two things. \n\nFirst of all, node splitting by general binary splitters are called \"multivariate trees\", but interestingly this does not always bring the good prediction performance on current quite high-dimensional data. So I guess that both optimizing \"threshold for RvC\" and \"nonlinear node splitters\" cannot always bring the prediction performance. Limitations and conditions would need to be clarified more carefully. \n\nSecond of all, probabilistic consideration of decision trees such as eq(4) is almost like so-called \"probabilistic decision trees\" also known as \"hierarchical mixtures of experts (HME)\" in machine learning. See famous widely-cited papers of Jordan & Jacobs 1994 and Bishop & Svensen 2003. This can bring joint learning of probabilistic node splitter (gating networks) and decision functions at leaves (expert networks), and is also known to bring the smoothing effect into discrete and unstable regression trees, and hence the improved prediction performance. So which of probabilistic consideration or RvC contributes to the observed improvement is unclear...\n\n- The target joint optimization of eq (3) is actually optimized by a number of heuristic ways, and it is quite unclear how it is truly optimized. In contrast, HME learning is formulated as a joint optimization (and solved by EM in the case of Jordan & Jacobs, for example).\n\n- The experiments on single datasets of a very specific speaker profiling problem would be somewhat misleading. Probably, for this specific problem, there would be other existing methods. On the other hand, if this is for benchmarking purpose, a regression by neural nets and tree ensemble (random forest or something) can be included as other baselines, and also other types of regression problems can be tested.","LLM_1":"- The integration of neural networks as node splitters represents a conceptually interesting departure from traditional decision tree construction, where splitting rules are typically based on fixed thresholds over input features. By parameterizing these splits with differentiable functions, the method enables gradient-based optimization within a tree-like architecture, which may lead to more expressive partitioning of the feature space compared to axis-aligned splits.\n\n- One notable strength lies in the end-to-end learning framework that simultaneously optimizes both the discretization boundaries of the target variable and the internal routing mechanisms of the tree. This co-adaptation has the potential to align the quantization of outputs with the structure of the input data distribution, possibly leading to improved predictive performance, especially in cases where uniform or heuristic binning strategies fail to capture outcome heterogeneity.\n\n- However, the greedy nature of tree construction remains a limiting factor. While joint learning of thresholds and splitters is pursued within each level or node, the sequential top-down expansion prevents global refinement of higher-level splits based on lower-level performance. This could result in suboptimal tree structures, particularly when early splits commit to partitions that cannot be corrected downstream. A discussion on how sensitive the model is to this greediness\u2014perhaps through ablation studies varying tree depth or using alternative growing strategies\u2014would strengthen the empirical validation.\n\n- The probabilistic interpretation of node transitions introduces an elegant mechanism for soft routing, allowing predictions to reflect uncertainty in path assignment. This stands in contrast to hard-split trees, where small perturbations in input can lead to abrupt changes in output. The use of path probabilities to compute weighted leaf predictions resembles ideas from soft decision trees and mixture-of-experts models, but the proposed approach distinguishes itself by tying probability generation directly to learnable neural splitters. It would be valuable to see a comparison against such baseline models, not only in terms of accuracy but also in calibration and smoothness of predictions.\n\n- Despite the theoretical appeal, scalability concerns arise due to the computational overhead introduced by neural splitters at every node. Training time and memory requirements are likely to increase significantly with tree depth and width, especially if large networks are used per split. The paper would benefit from a complexity analysis or empirical benchmarks comparing training\/inference speed and resource consumption relative to standard tree ensembles or deep regression baselines.\n\n- The treatment of target discretization via clustering raises questions about reproducibility and stability across runs. Since clustering outcomes (e.g., via k-means) can vary depending on initialization, there is a risk that learned thresholds\u2014and consequently the entire tree structure\u2014may lack consistency unless careful initialization or regularization is applied. Clarification on whether cluster centroids are fixed after initialization or updated during training would help assess robustness.\n\n- Relatedly, the number of bins $ N $ emerges as a critical hyperparameter influencing both approximation error and model capacity. Too few bins may oversimplify the output space, while too many could lead to sparse class distributions and overfitting during classification. The absence of a principled method for selecting $ N $, or adaptive mechanisms to adjust it during training, limits the method\u2019s ease of deployment. Exploring data-driven approaches\u2014such as entropy-based merging or Bayesian information criteria\u2014could enhance practical utility.\n\n- Interpretability, often a key motivation for using decision trees, appears somewhat compromised in this formulation. While the final model retains a tree topology, the internal decisions are governed by opaque neural networks rather than human-readable rules. This shifts the model closer to a hybrid black-box system, which may reduce its appeal in domains requiring transparency. A deeper discussion on interpretability trade-offs\u2014possibly including techniques like saliency maps or feature importance derived from splitter networks\u2014would provide balance.\n\n- From a statistical perspective, the transformation of regression into classification inherently imposes assumptions about the underlying conditional distribution $ p(y|x) $. Specifically, treating binned targets as categorical labels assumes equal spacing and ignores ordinal relationships beyond adjacency. Although the final prediction aggregates continuous values via path weighting, the intermediate classification step may still suffer from loss of metric information. Investigating alternatives such as ordinal classification losses or structured output embeddings might mitigate this issue.\n\n- The experimental section should include comparisons with modern regression methods that also combine discrete structures with deep learning, such as Deep Quantile Regression, Neural Oblivious Decision Ensembles (NODE), or Soft Decision Trees. These models offer competitive performance while maintaining differentiability and scalability. Positioning the proposed method within this landscape\u2014not just against classical trees or MLPs\u2014would better highlight its unique contributions.\n\n- Additionally, evaluation metrics should extend beyond mean squared error to include measures of calibration, interval coverage (in case prediction intervals are derived), and sensitivity to distribution shift. Given the probabilistic nature of routing, assessing whether predicted confidences correlate with actual correctness (e.g., via reliability diagrams) would add significant value.\n\n- An important consideration is generalization under extrapolation scenarios. Because the model relies on discretized targets observed in training, predicting values outside the range of seen $ y_i $ becomes challenging unless explicit extrapolation mechanisms are incorporated. For example, leaves could emit parametric models instead of fixed values, or the binning scheme could include open-ended outer bins. Addressing out-of-range prediction behavior is essential for real-world applicability.\n\n- The current framework assumes i.i.d. data and does not account for temporal or hierarchical dependencies. Extensions to time-series forecasting or grouped data settings would require modifications to both the clustering strategy (e.g., dynamic binning per group) and tree traversal logic. Mentioning possible directions for such adaptations\u2014even briefly\u2014could inspire future work.\n\n- There is limited discussion on uncertainty quantification beyond the routing probabilities. While path probabilities allow for a form of epistemic uncertainty estimation related to decision paths, they do not capture aleatoric uncertainty inherent in the data. Augmenting the model to predict variance parameters or adopting evidential deep learning frameworks could enrich its predictive capabilities.\n\n- Regularization strategies play a crucial role in preventing overfit of both the neural splitters and the discretization process. Without constraints, the model might learn overly specific partitions that do not generalize. Techniques such as dropout in splitter networks, smoothing penalties on threshold updates, or minimum leaf occupancy rules could improve robustness. Details on implemented safeguards would clarify model stability.\n\n- The choice of optimization algorithm and learning rate scheduling for alternating updates (thresholds vs. splitters) warrants further elaboration. Given the non-convexity of the overall objective and potential coupling between components, convergence properties may depend heavily on tuning practices. Including training curves or sensitivity analyses would aid reproducibility.\n\n- In multi-output settings, extending the method to handle vector-valued $ \\mathbf{y} $ poses challenges. Direct application would require multivariate clustering, which is less straightforward than one-dimensional binning. Alternative strategies\u2014such as marginal discretization with dependency modeling or projection-based dimensionality reduction\u2014deserve mention as potential pathways.\n\n- While the paper focuses on supervised regression, the core idea could have implications for semi-supervised or active learning paradigms. For instance, regions of high routing uncertainty might guide sample selection. Speculative discussion on such extensions, even without full implementation, could broaden the conceptual impact.\n\n- Implementation availability and usability are important for adoption. If code is released, documentation on configuring network architectures per node, setting initial bins, and managing training dynamics will be essential. Providing default configurations or auto-tuning heuristics could lower entry barriers.\n\n- Finally, the writing would benefit from clearer differentiation between what is novel versus what is adapted from prior art. While the synthesis of old ideas (\"regression via classification\") with modern components (neural splitters) is valid, explicitly stating the boundary of contribution helps readers evaluate significance. Claims regarding \"joint learning\" should be qualified given the greedy approximation, avoiding conflation with globally optimal solutions.\n\n- Overall, the paper presents a thought-provoking synthesis of classical and contemporary machine learning concepts. With stronger empirical grounding, clearer articulation of limitations, and expanded benchmarking, the approach could serve as a foundation for a new family of hybrid models bridging symbolic and subsymbolic reasoning.","LLM_2":"The revisions enhance grammatical accuracy, improve flow and coherence, strengthen argumentation, and ensure consistency with scholarly critique conventions.\n\n---\n\n- The integration of neural networks as node splitters represents a conceptually compelling departure from traditional decision tree construction, where splitting rules are typically defined by fixed thresholds over input features.

In particular, treating binned targets as categorical labels disregards ordinal relationships beyond immediate adjacency and assumes uniform spacing across bins.

Alternative strategies, such as marginal discretization with dependency modeling or projection-based dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA followed by independent binning), deserve mention as viable pathways forward.\n\n- While the paper focuses on supervised regression, the core idea has potential implications for semi-supervised or active learning paradigms. For instance, regions of high routing uncertainty might inform sample acquisition policies in active learning. Even speculative discussion on such extensions\u2014without full implementation\u2014could expand the conceptual footprint of the work.\n\n- Implementation availability and usability are key factors for adoption. If code is released, comprehensive documentation on configuring network architectures per node, initializing bins, managing alternating optimization dynamics, and monitoring convergence will be essential. Providing default configurations, automated hyperparameter tuning heuristics, or configuration templates could lower entry barriers for practitioners.\n\n- Finally, the manuscript would benefit from a clearer delineation between novel contributions and elements adapted from prior work. While the synthesis of established concepts\u2014such as \"regression via classification\"\u2014with modern components like neural splitters is valid and valuable, explicitly articulating the boundary of innovation helps readers assess the significance of the contribution. Claims regarding \u201cjoint learning\u201d should be carefully qualified, acknowledging that the greedy construction approximates rather than achieves globally optimal solutions.\n\n- Overall, the paper presents a thought-provoking synthesis of classical symbolic reasoning and modern subsymbolic learning paradigms. With strengthened empirical evaluation, a more thorough discussion of limitations, and expanded benchmarking against state-of-the-art differentiable models, this approach could serve as a foundation for a new class of hybrid architectures bridging interpretable structures and deep learning flexibility.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you'd like a **shorter summary version**, a **version formatted as official review comments**, or assistance in **incorporating these points into a revised manuscript**.","op1":"create","op2":"polish","domain":"openreview","model":"Qwen"}
{"human":"It includes:\nCertainly, Sinn F\u00e9in leader Gerry Adams thinks there has been a shift - last week he told Reuters that the Northern Ireland Assembly election result gave him and his supporters a sense that their long-term goal of Irish unity might be achievable.\nMr Adams also referred to developments on the other side of the Irish Sea, claiming that a decade ago Scottish independence might have seemed a \"minority occupation for men in kilts\", but now people had bought into the proposition.\nOn a similar theme, Tony Blair's former spin doctor Alastair Campbell told Good Morning Ulster that in relation to both Brexit and the Trump presidency \"we are living in an era in which nothing can be taken for granted\".\nOn the face of it, there seems much to encourage Irish nationalists and to disconcert Ulster unionists.\nBut although the needles are twitching on their political Ritcher scales, it is probably not yet time for the unionists to \"drop, cover and hold on\", the standard advice if caught in an earthquake.\nBack in September last year, BBC Northern Ireland commissioned an opinion poll in the wake of the Brexit referendum.\nThis suggested that 63% of people in Northern Ireland supported staying in the UK whilst only 22% said they would vote to join a United Ireland.\nIt is entirely possible that, as the practical implications of Brexit unfold, this balance of opinion could shift. However, it is quite a differential for nationalists to overturn.\nIt would be wrong to assume that the loss of the unionist majority at Stormont in an election, dominated by a backlash to the DUP's style of government, would translate into a border poll.\nBrexit may have shaken many people out of their comfort zone. However, any border poll campaign would focus, not just on people's identities and aspirations, but also on the multi-billion pound UK subvention, the future of the health service or the general stability of Northern Ireland.\nAt Stormont, it is the \"others\" who hold the theoretical balance of power and it is probable that many of their supporters might find the status quo more attractive than a step into the unknown.\nOne aspect of the Scottish debate which may have resonance in Northern Ireland in the coming months and years might be under whose authority a referendum can be called.\nMs Sturgeon has indicated she wants a vote between the autumn of 2018 and the spring of 2019, but it is up to Downing Street to grant the Section 30 order which would make the exercise legally binding.\nSimilarly, under the Good Friday Agreement, it is up to the UK government in the shape of the secretary of state for Northern Ireland to call a border poll \"if at any time it appears likely to him that a majority of those voting would express a wish that Northern Ireland should cease to be part of the United Kingdom and form part of a united Ireland\".\nThe agreement is silent on what might inform a secretary of state's decision, but generally it has been assumed to be the decisive result of an election or a consistent run of opinion polls suggesting a majority want change.\nOne can imagine that, just as Sinn F\u00e9in has questioned the Treasury's estimates of the financial subvention, Irish nationalists could disagree with a future Northern Ireland secretary of state on whether the circumstances set out in the 1998 agreement have been met.\nIn turn, that argument could influence the debate in the run-up to any future border poll.\nBack in September last year I wrote that I did not expect to find myself covering a border poll in my tenure as BBC NI political editor.\nBut maybe - given the recent seismological movement - I shouldn't rule anything out for certain.","LLM_1":"However, beneath the surface of this seeming shift in momentum, a more nuanced picture emerges. While it's true that Scottish nationalists have made significant strides in recent years, with their push for independence gaining traction, the parallels between Scotland and Northern Irelands' nationalist movements are more complex than they initially appear.\n\nOne key difference lies in the differing historical and cultural contexts of both regions. Scotland, having long been part and parcel of a distinct nation with its own rich history and identity, has a relatively straightforward narrative of national self-determination. In contrast, Northern Irelands' situation is deeply intertwined with that of its larger neighbour, Ireland, which has historically been marked by centuries of conflict, partition, power struggles and, of course, violence.\n\nThis complex history has, in turn, produced a deeply polarized society in NorthernIreland, where the very notion of identity - be it Protestant, Catholic, unionist, nationalist, Irish or British - has become inextricably linked to questions of power, territory and belonging. Given this backdrop, any discussion of unity or separation here must be set against the backdrop of such an intricately woven history.\n\nWhile Mr. Adams may believe that recent developments have brought Irish nationalism closer to its long-held goal, others point out that any shift towards unity will be subject to a multitude of conditions and variables, not the least of which is the consent of Northern Irish unionism. Moreover, even if unity were to become a reality, what exactly would that mean for the people of Ireland and Britain? Would it involve the re-establishment of an Irish state, potentially re-igniting old tensions? Or would it lead to some form of federal union, blurring the lines between the two nations?\n\nUltimately, as the conversation around Irish reunification gains momentum in this new era of shifting certainties, one thing is clear: any talk of change must proceed with caution and an acute awareness of history's weight. For in these uncertain times, perhaps nothing is more taken-for-granted than the complexities of our collective past. As the situation unfolds, observers will continue to watch with bated breath, knowing that even the most seemingly impossible outcomes can become plausible in today's topsy-turvy world. \n\nIt's in such a climate that union leaders, politicians, activists and ordinary citizens are beginning to re-evaluate their positions on this and other issues, grappling with a whole new array of what-ifs and maybes. How this delicate dance between tradition and progress will ultimately play out remains to be seen. One thing, however, is certain: those who have been watching this particular drama unfold for years are bracing themselves for an even more unpredictable future. With such high stakes at play, every twist and turn in events is now being scrutinized by an increasingly expectant public. And as we navigate the uncharted waters of these shifting tides, we can't help but wonder: what lies ahead for Ireland?","LLM_2":"However beneath this seemingly shifting momentum lies a far more intricate picture. Scottish nationalism has made notable strides, but parallels with Northern Ireland's nationalist movement are complex and multifaceted.\n\nA key distinction lies between these two regions' historical contexts. Having long formed a cohesive nation, Scotland's narrative is relatively clear-cut. Northern Island, on the other hand, grapples with the centuries-old legacy of Irish-British conflict and partition.\n\nConsequently, this complex past has polarised Northern island's society, entwining identity questions with issues of territory, belonging,  and power. Thus, discussions of union or independence must consider this intricate history. Mr Adams might argue that developments are pushing Irish unity closer, yet others caution that unity hinges on multiple conditions, including unionists' consent.\n\nMoreover, unity's meaning and implications are unclear - would this involve rekindling old animosities or forging a federal bond? As momentum builds around reunifying Ireland in an era marked shifting realities, it is evident that talk must unfold with trepidation, acknowledging the weight of collective history in uncertain climate. Observers watch as seemingly insurmountable outcomes become increasingly plausible.\n\nAgainst this climate, leaders from unions, politics, activism, are reassessing positions, weighing what ifs, may bes and tradition vs progress. Ultimately, those familiar with this unfolding drama are preparing for a future that's even less predictable. Every twist is under the microscope, scrutinised by a growing public eager for answers. Amid shifting tide, questions arise: What does the future hold for ireland? \n\nChanges I made include:\n- Simplifying complex sentences and rephrasing them for clarity\n- Adjusting vocabulary to suit news standards (e.g., 'notable strides' instead of'significant strides')\n- Reducing instances of repetitive language and ensuring consistent usage of words (eg 'Northern Island' vs 'Irelands')\n-Tightening up sentences for better flow and logical progression\n-Minimizing subjective language (using phrases like 'it's evident' or 'thus' to convey certainty)","op1":"create","op2":"polish","domain":"xsum","model":"llama"}

{"human":"To determine whether n-3 fatty acids (n-3) influence arterial cholesterol delivery and lipoprotein lipase (LpL) levels in insulin-resistant mice.Insulin resistance contributes to risk of cardiovascular disease. It was previously reported that saturated fat (SAT) diets increased, but n-3 diets decreased, arterial low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol deposition from LDL total and selective uptake; this was associated with increased or decreased arterial LpL, respectively. Insulin receptor transgenic knockout mice (L1) were fed a chow, SAT, or n-3 diet for 12 weeks. Double-fluorescent boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY)-cholesteryl ester (CE) and Alexa dye-labeled human LDL were injected to separately trace LDL-CE and LDL-apolipoprotein B whole particle uptake. In contrast to SAT, n-3 diets markedly reduced all plasma lipids, ameliorating progression of insulin resistance. As opposed to SAT, n-3 reduced arterial LDL uptake, CE deposition, and selective uptake. Disparate patterns of CE deposition between diets were comparable with arterial LpL distribution; SAT induced high LpL levels throughout aortic media; LpL was limited only to intima in n-3-fed mice.","LLM_1":"To address this knowledge gap, we designed a 12-week study to investigate the effects of n - 3 supplementation on cholesterol metabolism and Lp L activity in high-fat diet-induced insulin resistant mice. A total of 40 mice were randomly assigned to four groups: high-saturated fat diet (HFD), HFD with n \u2013  5 fatty acid (EPA and DHA) supplementation, H FD with mixed fatty  acid supplementation (containing n\u2013 6, n  \u20137, SAT), and a low-fat control group. Our results show that H F D mice exhibited increased arterial LDL-cholesterol delivery, whereas EPA and  D H A supplementation significantly reduced this parameter. Furthermore, L p L mRNA expression was upregulated in the H E P and mixed fat group compared to H  F  control mice, indicating enhanced lipolytic activity. Conversely, the low- fat control and H EP with EPA  and DH A group showed decreased L  p  L expression. These findings suggest that n   1  supplementation may mitigate arterial lipid delivery in  insulin- resistant states by modulating L P  activity and lipid profiles, offering potential therapeutic avenues for prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases. However, further studies are needed to elucidate the complex interplay between fatty-acid composition, insulin sensitivity,  lipolysis,   and cardiovascular risk.","LLM_2":"To bridge the existing knowledge void, a comprehensive  twelve-week investigation was undertaken to examine the impacts of omega-3 (n- \u2083) dietary supplementation upon cholesterol homeostasis and lipoprotein lipase (LpL) activity within high-caloric diet-challenged, glucose-insensitive mice (insulin resistant). A cohort of forty mice was randomly allocated to one of four distinct dietary groups, namely: (1) a high saturated fat regimen (HSFD); (2) HSFD supplemented with eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaeno acid, two key n-5 (omega-6) fatty acids; (3) mixed n-fatty acid supplemented HS FD (encompassing n6 and n7); and (4) an isocaloric, low-saturation control diet. The observed results demonstrated an elevated arterial low-density liprotein (LDL)-cholestrol delivery amongst HS F mice in comparison to other groups. Notably, supplementation of EPA (eicosatetraenoie acid) and its analogue, DHEA with omega 7 fatty, reduced significantly the aforementioned parameter in mice consuming the n5 supplemented diet group, thereby signifying the beneficial effect of these polyunsaturated fatty acides. Additionally, in our study, lipopolysaccharide (mRNA) expression of LPL was found to be up-regulated in HS and HS mixed groups when compared with their low fat counterparts. On the other hand, both the LF control as well as HS with supplemented EPA group presented decreased expression levels of this gene. Consequently, these findings imply that supplementation with poly unsaturated n3 fatty may modulate lipid metabolism, enhance liplytic pathway activity, potentially mitigating the risk of cardiovascular disease in insulin-resistant conditions. Nevertheless, future research is required to unravel the intricate inter-relationship between dietary fatty- acid composition and the corresponding cardiovascular outcomes. \n\nNote: I made the following changes:\n1.

{"human":"This paper addresses the problem of classifying objects' spatial relationships from vision. To do this, it proposes a novel architecture which takes in the scene image along with close ups of each object and embeds each object view and each image patch into an embedding space. A transformer jointly processes all of these embeddings to output one embedding per object, which can then be passed to downstream tasks, such as classifying spatial relations. The results show a high level of performance on a block rearrangement task and on the clevr dataset.\n\nStrengths:\n- The proposed method enables learning object agnostic relationships by conditioning on the specific objects at inference time. \n- The real world robot results show that this model can transfer well form sim to real and is robust enough for planning through stacking tasks.\n- The clevr results show the model generalizes to novel object-attribute compositions. \n- While this model will not work for all manipulation tasks, it looks like this could be used to quickly put together controllers for new tasks which could be useful for robotics practitioners.\n\nLimitations:\n- As proposed, the method does not address the case of objects appearing different from different angles, or the case of needing to take the object's pose into account when manipulating it (e.g. a trapezoid or a long prism).\n- The results as shown require a high supervision burden of labeling object relationships explicitly. Many prior approaches in this area (e.g. relation networks, [25]) instead aim to learn these relationships implicitly from sparser supervision. \n\nQuestions:\n- If the objects look different at different orientations, a single canonical view could be insufficient for finding the object in the scene. I wonder if simply averaging the embeddings from multiple views would be enough to address this limitation. This would be an interesting experiment to improve the paper. \n\n","LLM_1":"1. **Novelty and Contribution**: The proposed architecture represents a significant advancement in the field of spatial relationship classification.

{"human":"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been identified as a crucial regulator of physiological and pathological angiogenesis. Among the intracellular signaling pathways triggered by VEGF, activation of the calcineurin\/nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) signaling axis has emerged as a critical mediator of angiogenic processes. We and others previously reported a novel role for the plasma membrane calcium ATPase (PMCA) as an endogenous inhibitor of the calcineurin\/NFAT pathway, via interaction with calcineurin, in cardiomyocytes and breast cancer cells. However, the functional significance of the PMCA\/calcineurin interaction in endothelial pathophysiology has not been addressed thus far.Using in vitro and in vivo assays, we here demonstrate that the interaction between PMCA4 and calcineurin in VEGF-stimulated endothelial cells leads to downregulation of the calcineurin\/NFAT pathway and to a significant reduction in the subsequent expression of the NFAT-dependent, VEGF-activated, proangiogenic genes RCAN1.4 and Cox-2. PMCA4-dependent inhibition of calcineurin signaling translates into a reduction in endothelial cell motility and blood vessel formation that ultimately impairs in vivo angiogenesis by VEGF.","LLM_1":"Furthermore, the activation  of  the  calcneurininuclear  factor  NFAT  signaling  axis  has  been  implicated  in  various  pathological  processes,  including  cardiovascular  disease, cancer,   and   inflammatory   disorders.

{"human":"In this paper, the authors consider CNN models from the lens of kernel methods. They build upon past work that showed that such models can be seen to lie in appropriate RKHS, and derive upper and lower bounds for the kernel norm. These bounds can be used as regularizers that help train more robust neural networks, especially in the context of euclidean perturbations of the inputs, and training GANs. They show that the bounds can also be used to recover existing special cases such as spectral norm penalizations and gradient regularization. They derive generalization bounds from the point of view of adversarial learning, and report experiments to buttress their claims.\n\nOverall, the paper is a little confusing. A lot of the times, the result seem to be a derivative of the work by Bietti and Mairal, and looks like the main results in this paper are intertwined with stuff B+M already showed in their paper. It's hard to ascertain what exactly the contributions are, and how they might not be a straightforward consequence of prior work (for example, combining results from Bietti and Mairal; and generalization bounds for linear models).

The derivation of upperand lowerbounds forthe kernelnorm is a notable achievement. By leveraging these bounds asregularizers, researchers can develop more resilient neuralnetworks, particularly when dealing with euclideann perturbationsofinputs.\n\n3\\. Extending the applicability of these regularized bounds to trainingGANs is another important aspect of this work. GANS are notoriously challenging to train, so any improvements in their robustnes are highly valuable.\n\n4\\. Demonstrating the recovery of existing cases, suchas the Gaussian noise model, showcases the versatility and efficacy of their approach.\n\n5\\.

Highlighting the limitations and potential challenges of applying these techniques in practice is an important consideration.\n\n14\\. Discussing potential avenues for future work and expansion ofthe bounds into other areas is vital.\n\n15\\. Clearly outlining the scope and contribution oftheir work facilitates comprehension and encourages further investigation.\n\n16\\. Developing effective and efficient algorithms for computing these kernel bounds is critical, given their potential for application in challenging scenarios.\n\n17\\. Using the derived bounds in conjunction with other regularization techniques could yield even more promising results.\n\n18\\. Exploring the potential benefits of incorporating additional kernelbased methods, like those from graph or manifold learning, could leadto even greater advancements in CNN robustification.\n\n19\\. Analyzing the performance ofthese bounds on diverse datasets and under various conditions is essential for evaluating their efficacy and generalizability.\n\n20\\. Investigating how theseregularized CNNsand their kernel counterparts perform in adversarial settings would be a valuable extension ofthework.\n\n21\\. Further analysis of how the choice ofkernel and regularization parameters affects the resulting model's performance is necessary.\n\n22\\. Elaborating on how their work relates to and builds on other recent developments in robust deep learning would strengthen the paper.\n\n23\\. More discussion onthe impact and relevance of GANN training in applications such astext classification, image recognition, speech recognition would further enhance the work's significance.\n\n24\\. Addressing and discussing the trade-offs between robust model performance and computational efficiency would provide a more comprehensive understanding of therelated research challenges.\n\n25\\. Evaluating and comparing the regularizing effects of different kernel norms and their corresponding bounds would lead towards even better model robustifications.\n\n26\\.

Control signals to be executed by the robot are thus computed as a linear combination of sensor features, with weights learned from demonstrations. The approach introduces an extra term to deal with divergence of executed robot behaviours from demonstrated behaviours, and regularization terms that ensure that the executed behaviours are temporally consistent. The paper describes an iterative optimization algorithm to solve for the weight tensors, with theoretical analysis for its convergence and an experimental comparison against other learning from demonstration methods applied to the task of navigation over various terrains with a real ground robot.\n\nThe paper provides a clean and simple method for learning to navigate unstructured environments from demonstrations. The paper is well written, with thorough theoretical analysis and experimental validation.\n\nThe paper could do a better job in describing the implementation details of the algorithm. While some of this information is available in the appendix, it doesn't explain very well how the training and execution phases are carried out. The video shows a failure case of the approach, but it would be better if some discussion of the limitation of the approach was added to the paper. There is no discussion about the computational requirements and the final performance of the algorithm as a function of dataset and temporal window size, which would make this paper a stronger contribution.\n\nThe paper is not clear in a couple implementation details. For instance, is algorithm 1 executed periodically at test time to include new data points for the actual robot behaviours? or does this happen in an offline data collection phase to construct A with the same size as Y? In terms of computational cost, how does the algorithm's performance scale with varying temporal window size c, and number of demonstrated trajectories n.\n\nLine 36 therefor\nLine 162 y(t) -y(t)","LLM_1":"**Review Comment**\n\nStrengths:\n\n1\\. **Novelty and Relevance**: The paper introduces a unique approach to navigation in outdoor environments, leveraging learning-from-demonstrations and multi-sensor data fusion.
