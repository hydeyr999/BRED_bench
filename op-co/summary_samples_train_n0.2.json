{"human":"Meperidine has local anesthetic properties and, therefore, when given epidurally it has the potential to cause hemodynamic changes. Our objective was to study the hemodynamic effects of an analgesic dose of epidural meperidine (50 mg) in 34 ASA 1-2 term parturients scheduled for elective Cesarean section under epidural anesthesia.A lumbar epidural catheter was inserted and patients lay in the supine left wedge position. Intravenous fluid preload was withheld, and hemodynamic measurements comprising of mean arterial pressure, cardiac output and heart rate were made using automatic oscillotonometry (Dinamap 1486SX) and transthoracic electrical bioimpedance (Bomed NCCOM3). Following baseline measurements, the hemodynamic effects of sequential epidural injection of first, 10 ml saline, and 20 min thereafter, 50 mg meperidine diluted to 10 ml with saline, were recorded. Sensory blockade was assessed following each injection using loss of temperature discrimination to ice. Paired Student t tests were used to compare changes in hemodynamic variables.Epidural meperidine produced a small increase from the saline values in the mean (SD) cardiac output of 5.81 +\/-1.44 to 6.04+\/-1.54 L x min(-1) (P<0.05), and mean arterial pressure of 77.1+\/-8.8 to 79.3+\/-9.9 mm Hg (P<0.05).

{"human":"       I am utterly useless at packing. Not so much at figuring out what to take and putting it in a bag, but just getting the job done. There keeps being distractions... I've got t-shirts covered, at least.  Since I'm off to Auckland tomorrow to do some gigz, I figured I'd do a wee roundup on gigz I've been to lately. [For an explanation of the plural 'z' phenomenon that's gripped me lately see the  urlLink Video Kid  interview in  urlLink A Low Hum 11 .] Last Thursday I saw Gramsci and Tommy at Happy. I got there a little into Gramsci's set but nonetheless was quickly mesmerised by his powerful delivery and lovely melodies. Nice. New album out I think? Tommy played for bloody ages, got the crowds moving though. On reflection that's the only gig I've been to lately. Stayed home Friday, and Saturday I attended my own virtual gig with the help of Singstar at Jane's birthday. We got pretty competitive - I think Jane and I got the top scores, both of us ranking 'Hit Artist' for Blondie's 'Heart of Glass'. So, I lied when I said 'Take On Me' by Aha was the only good track.  Clearly I'm not at MC5 (or Jurassic 5) tonight... yeah I know, rock n roll legacy and all that, but I've got weekend expenditure to think of. I considered attempting to sneak up the back stairs at Indigo but considering I've been hassling Brendan for a ticket it wouldn't be seemly.  However earlier today I did have the privilege of sitting in on the final rehearsal for  urlLink Fly My Pretties , which opens at  urlLink Bats  tomorrow. If you don't have a ticket, sorry, it's sold out. Even the just-added extra late Friday show! Wow. The creativity was palpable, all those accomplished musicians in the same space - there's so many they even have to share instruments. I was rather upset to have missed 'Bag of Money', being my fave Barnaby song, unless of course I had to choose from  urlLink Flash Harry  as well... anyway what I did see was pretty cher, the set looked cool, but most of all it was exhilarating to witness the collaboration of such a crew of Wellington's finest.  Tomorrow morning I get to go to work for just as long as it takes to sort out one file then I get to leave to drive to Auckland with three nice boys!! Cool.

Let me tell you, there\u2019s something magical about being in a room full of artists who just *get it* \u2014 the harmonies, the staging, the spontaneous bursts of inspiration. The vibe was electric, and word must\u2019ve spread fast, because the shows sold out almost instantly. So fast, in fact, that they had to add a late-night encore performance. Sold out twice? That\u2019s the kind of momentum you can\u2019t fake.\n\nWhich brings me back to Auckland. The plan? Load up the car, hit the road with a carload of friends, and dive headfirst into gig mode.

{"human":"San Diego-based Illumina says it is to release a new sequencing machine that can deliver five genomes in a day.\nThe race to unlock a human's genetic blueprint for $1,000 has been underway for more than a decade.\nThe Archon X Prize had offered $10m to the first team that hit this target or came closest, until the contest was cancelled in August 2013.\nThe term was thought up as a symbolic landmark that would, in theory, light the fires of a long-anticipated revolution in personalised medicine.\nUnderstanding how genes influence disease could lead to better treatments for patients.\nThe HiSeq X Ten high throughput genetic sequencing machine was announced at the annual JP Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco this week.\nIn his presentation at the meeting, Illumina's chief executive Jay Flatley said the HiSeq X Ten would improve on the scanning speed of its predecessor by a factor of six. This would offer the ability to sequence five whole human genomes in a single day, Bio-IT World reported.\nHe said the $1m sequencers (sold in a minimum of 10 units) would be able to deliver a genome for just under $1,000 (\u00c2\u00a3610; 735 euros), consistent with calculations the National Human Genome Research Institute uses to estimate sequencing costs.\nIn his presentation, Mr Flatley said the world was \"entering the supersonic age of genomics\".\n\"For the first time, it looks like it will be possible to deliver the $1,000 genome, which is tremendously exciting,\" said Eric Lander, a founding director of the Broad Institute in Massachusetts - which has bought 14 units.\n\"The HiSeq X Ten should give us the ability to analyse complete genomic information from huge sample populations. Over the next few years, we have an opportunity to learn as much about the genetics of human disease as we have learned in the history of medicine.\"\nOn his blog, Mick Watson, a computational biologist at the University of Edinburgh, checked the maths behind Illumina's claims for the HiSeq X Ten.\n\"I think they might be right in claiming the $1000 genome - if you do 18,000 human genomes per year for four years on each X Ten system. That's a lot of human genomes though,\" he wrote.\nThe term \"$1,000 genome\" was coined in 2001 at a closed scientific meeting to discuss the future of biomedical research. A year later, it became the subject of a symposium in Boston hosted by entrepreneur and genome pioneer Dr Craig Venter.\nIn the last few years, the decline in the cost of genome sequencing had outpaced the famous Moore's Law, which describes how computer processors double in complexity every two years. Nevertheless, the target proved difficult to reach, even with large sums of money on offer.\nDr Venter's foundation offered $500,000 to the first team able to realise $1,000 genome sequencing.\nThis sum was subsequently rolled into the Archon X Prize competition which was to have awarded $10m to successful scientists. However, this contest was cancelled in August 2013 because the effort had, in the words of X Prize co-founder Peter Diamandis, been \"outpaced by innovation\".\n\"What we realised is that genome sequencing technology is plummeting in cost and increasing in speed independent of our competition,\" he explained in a column for the Huffington Post.\nPaul.Rincon-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter","LLM_1":"Illumina has unveiled a new sequencing machine, the HiSeq X Ten, capable of sequencing five human genomes in a day at a cost approaching $1,000 per genome.

{"human":"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is driven by a seemingly aberrant immune response to the gut microbiota with disease development dictated by genetics and environmental factors. A model exemplifying this notion is our recent demonstration that colonisation of adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC) during microbiota acquisition drove chronic colitis in mice lacking the flagellin receptor TLR5 (T5KO). T5KO colitis persisted beyond AIEC clearance and requires TLR4 and the NLRC4 inflammasome. We hypothesised that AIEC instigates chronic inflammation by increasing microbial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and flagellin levels.Examine if transient AIEC colonisation lastingly alters levels of LPS and flagellin and changes microbiota composition.Germ-free mice (wild type (WT) and T5KO) were inoculated with AIEC strain LF82 and placed in standard housing allowing a complex microbiota that eliminated AIEC in both mice strains. Faeces were assayed for the inflammatory marker, lipocalin-2, bacterial loads, and microbiota composition by pyrosequencing. Faecal LPS and flagellin bioactivity were measured via a cell-based reporter assay.Transient AIEC colonisation, in WT mice, did not alter inflammatory markers, bacterial loads, microbiota composition, nor its pro-inflammatory potential. By contrast, transient AIEC colonisation of T5KO mice drove chronic inflammation which correlated with microbiota components having higher levels of bioactive LPS and flagellin. Such AIEC-induced elevation of LPS and flagellin persisted well beyond AIEC clearance, required AIEC be flagellated, and was associated with alteration in microbiota species composition including a loss of species diversity.","LLM_1":"Inflammation in the bowel is caused by an abnormal immune system response, influenced by genetic and environment factors, as seen in a study on mice. Researchers found that brief exposure to a specific type of bacteria, AECI, led to chronic bowel inflammation in some mice but not others. This inflammation persisted even after the bacteria were cleared and required specific receptors to occur. Results showed that the altered microbiome in these mice had higher bio-active lipids and proteins, leading to inflammation and loss in species variety. These findings suggest a possible link between the immune and gut systems.","LLM_2":"Chronic bowel inflation is a complex phenomenon resulting from an aberrant immune response in an individual, which is shaped by the interplay of genetic predispositions and environmental factors. A seminal study conducted on a murine model has shed light on this condition, revealing that transient exposure of mice to specific strains of AEEC (Antibiotic-Induced Colitis-Associated Escherichia coli) bacteria triggers the onset of persistent bowel irritation in certain animals, yet fails to induce a similar response among others.\n\nA key observation from this research is that this inflammation persists even following the clearance of these bacteria and necessitates the presence of specific receptor molecules. The ensuing alterations in gut microbiota composition in affected mice are characterized by elevated levels of bioactive lipoids and peptides, contributing to sustained inflammation. Notably, this microbial dysbiosis also results in diminished species diversity.\n\nThese findings imply a potential association between immune dysregulation and disruptions in host-microbiome homeostasis, underscoring the intricate interconnections between these two critical systems in maintaining intestinal health. Further investigation into the mechanistic underpinnings of this complex relationship may yield novel insights into prevention and treatment strategies for chronic inflammatory bowel diseases.","op1":"summary","op2":"polish","domain":"pubmedqa","model":"llama"}

But instead of paddling for shore, Bob does what any modern, tech-reliant human would do: he whips out his surfboard\u2019s touchscreen and frantically searches, *\u201cemergency shark evasion tactics.\u201d*\n\nNo results found.\n\nOr rather, plenty of results\u2014but nothing useful. Just sponsored links for eco-friendly wax and a dubious blog post titled *\u201c10 Ways Sharks Secretly Want to Be Your Best Friend.\u201d* Meanwhile, the shark\u2014portrayed not just as hungry, but surprisingly tech-savvy\u2014grins (as much as a shark can grin). With Bob distracted by slow load times and irrelevant search algorithms, dinner practically swims right into his jaws.\n\nThe real punchline? In this satirical vision of our hyper-connected future, even predators get an upgrade. The article jokingly forecasts the next frontier: legal battles between sharks and surfers over \u201cunauthorized data collection,\u201d followed swiftly by the launch of *Google Surfbar*\u2014a browser optimized for oceanic browsing, complete with wave-resistant interface and shark-avoidance pop-up blockers.\n\nIt\u2019s a tongue-in-cheek commentary on our growing dependence on technology\u2014even in situations where instinct, speed, and maybe just *swimming really fast* might be the better tools. After all, when you\u2019re face-to-face with a apex predator, no app is going to save you\u2026 unless it\u2019s called *RunFromShark.exe*\u2014and even then, good luck with the download speed.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you'd like a shorter version, a different tone (e.g., more sarcastic, more journalistic), or want to add images or captions!","op1":"summary","op2":"polish","domain":"blog","model":"Qwen"}
{"human":"Environmental anthropology is a sub-specialty within the field of anthropology that takes an active role in examining the relationships between humans and their environment across space and time. The contemporary perspective of environmental anthropology, and arguably at least the backdrop, if not the focus of most of the ethnographies and cultural fieldworks of today, is political ecology. Many characterize this new perspective as more informed with culture, politics and power, globalization, localized issues, and more. The focus and data interpretation is often used for arguments for\/against or creation of policy, and to prevent corporate exploitation and damage of land. Often, the observer has become an active part of the struggle either directly (organizing, participation) or indirectly (articles, documentaries, books, ethnographies). Such is the case with environmental justice advocate Melissa Checker and her relationship with the people of Hyde Park.","LLM_1":"Environmental anthropology studies human-environment interactions through time and space, emphasizing political ecology and addressing cultural, political, and globalized issues. It often informs policy and resists corporate exploitation, with researchers actively engaging in advocacy through fieldwork and media.","LLM_2":"**Environmental anthropology** is a subfield of anthropology that examines the dynamic relationships between humans and their environments across historical and geographical contexts. It integrates perspectives from **political ecology** to analyze how cultural practices, political structures, and globalization shape, and are shaped by, ecological systems. The discipline frequently addresses issues such as resource distribution, environmental justice, and the impacts of corporate activities on communities and ecosystems.\n\nA distinctive feature of environmental anthropology is its applied and engaged approach. Research often informs public policy and supports grassroots resistance against exploitative practices. Practitioners commonly participate in advocacy through immersive fieldwork, collaborative projects with local populations, and engagement with various media platforms to amplify marginalized voices and promote sustainable alternatives.","op1":"summary","op2":"polish","domain":"squad","model":"ds"}
{"human":"Summary:\nThe paper proposes a method for sequential and adaptive selection of training examples to be\npresented to the training algorithm. The selection happens in a latent space, based on choosing\nsamples which are in the direction of gradient of the loss in the latent space. Two selection\nstrategies are investigated: nearest neighbor and interpolation followed by generation. Results on\nshown on MNIST, CIFAR10 and IVUS (Intravascular Ultrasound) datasets.\n\nDetailed comments:                      \nThe proposed method works in two stages. First a VAE is trained using unannotated samples. In the\nsecond stage, hard examples are found, in every iteration, in the latent space of the VAE and used\nfor sequential training. The sampling is done using the gradient of the objective function in the\nlatent space. The method makes sense, however the choice of space in which the sample selection is\nbeing done is not well motivated or validated. The space could have been the original image space\n(although given the high dimension, it would probably not work), or could have been any intermediate\nfeature space. Why was the space chosen to be the VAE latent space? Would it be possible to \ndemonstrate some benefits of doing so, theoretically and empirically? \n\nThe experiment section is relatively weak. The datasets used are relatively small and in two out of\nthe three datasets, the method does not improve. The dimension of the latent space is also\nsurprisingly small (2). While the main body of the paper describes the method with VAEs, the\nexperiments for the CIFAR10 dataset (where the results were in favor) were done \n\\alpha-GAN.","LLM_1":"The comment discusses a paper proposing a sequential selection method of adaptive training samples in latent spaces. It suggests that the chosen space for sample collection, V AE latent, lacks motivation and validation, and that alternative spaces could be explored. Additionally, experiments are considered weak due to small datasets and limited improvement in some cases. Finally, inconsistencies in model choice for certain datasets are noted.","LLM_2":"While the paper presents an interesting approach to sequential sample selection in adaptive latent training, there are some aspects that warrant further discussion. Specifically, it is unclear why the authors chose the VAE latent space as the primary setting for their method, particularly given the lack of explicit motivation or validation for this choice. Exploring alternative latent representations could provide valuable insights and help to establish a stronger foundation for the proposed approach. Moreover, some experiments appear limited by the use of small-scale datasets, which may not fully capture the method's potential benefits. Lastly, I noticed inconsistencies across model choices for different datasets; a more careful consideration of these choices might strengthen the overall results. \n\nThis rewritten comment aims to preserve your original points and intent, presented in the required format and tone of an open review comment.

I have nooooo idea why.  Was a bit late again missing warmup and all that. Not a good idea coz it's the same both times I popped down to BVCC that this had happened. Really need to keep my timing in check.  Today was the first time I paired up with Sunny (kowtows to Nidan ... capable of some really hard throws). I can tell you every iriminage he did on me, I didn't get what he was trying to get across to me. Seriously ... I only thought I understood it the final time he did it and then it was over liao. Wasted. Didn't even manage to take a decent ukemi for him. Fell like a piece of rock each time and I know I could've hurt myself badly if he really wanted to throw me.

No frustration at not 'getting it' either.  Today's a weird mood of training for me... but a happy one.  Out've the blue my mom was in the neighbourhood to pick me up.

{"human":"He had been a devout man all his life. Tough as it got sometimes, his base urges running rampant through his body, he stuck to his faith. His personal oath with something larger than man. His mind kept his body in check through long and painful years filled with loneliness and despair. Sometimes the promise of heaven being all keeping him upright, for suicide was a sure way down to hell. Stealing your gift from the lord. He had cared for the weak and supported the needy, mostly with little return. But in time, his time had come. And somewhere in his mind he was glad for the end. Society as he would have liked it had never existed on his earth. Civilisation without civility being a main issue he had had with life. Now, as he ascended the stairway to eternal bliss a smile cracked his face for the first time since the disease had started wrecking him. A kindly old man stood at the top of the path, nodding at him with a sagely smile. The man nodded back and walked up to him, extending a hand. The bearded man took his hand and gave it a firm shake. Mutely he was guided to a gate of gold and silver, which opened as they approached. The old man urged him on, he himself pausing at the edge of the gate. \n \n With a small step he crossed the threshold.

{"human":"Matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) is responsible for the degradation of various types of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins such as type IV collagen. Decreased MMP-2 expression and activity has been generally thought to contribute to increased accumulation of ECM at the advanced stage of diabetic nephropathy. However, the kinetics and role of MMP-2 in the early phase of diabetic nephropathy remain unclear. To address this issue, we examined whether streptozotocin (STZ)-induced early diabetic nephropathy was accelerated in MMP-2 knockout (KO) mice.Diabetes was induced by the injection of STZ in 6-week-old control and MMP-2 KO mice. Animals were killed after 16 weeks of diabetes of after observation alone.Compared with non-diabetic control mice, renal MMP-2 expression and activity were increased in 16-week old diabetic mice. Serum levels of blood urea nitrogen and creatinine and urinary excretion levels of albumin and N-acetyl-\u03b2-D-glucosaminidase were significantly elevated in diabetic MMP-2 KO mice when compared with wild-type diabetic littermates. Further, accumulation of ECM in the glomeruli and atrophy and fibrosis in the tubulointerstitium were exacerbated, and renal \u03b1-smooth muscle actin expression was enhanced in diabetic MMP-2 KO mice.","LLM_1":"Increased renal MMP-2 expression and activity in early diabetic nephropathy protect against kidney damage, as MMP-2 knockout mice with STZ-induced diabetes show worse renal function, greater ECM accumulation, glomerular and tubulointerstitial injury, and elevated fibrosis markers compared to wild-type diabetic mice.","LLM_2":"**Polished Version:**\n\nElevated renal matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) expression and activity in early diabetic nephropathy appear to exert protective effects against kidney injury. In streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice, MMP-2 deficiency exacerbates renal dysfunction, extracellular matrix accumulation, glomerular and tubulointerstitial damage, and fibrosis marker expression compared to wild-type diabetic controls, suggesting a renoprotective role for MMP-2 in the early stages of diabetic nephropathy.\n\nLet me know if you'd like a shorter or more technical variation depending on journal requirements.","op1":"summary","op2":"polish","domain":"pubmedqa","model":"Qwen"}

{"human":"Any other person would have been allowed to come into the shop. Basically my boss was cool with just about anybody doing business with us, so long as they were willing to pay money and get out of the way for the next shmuck in line. Carter was the one person that was banned from the store; something neither he or my boss were comfortable talking about. \n \n Driving home from work last week, I noticed Carter hanging around the stoop of the Old Post Office where he was having a smoke. Evading my gaze as I drove past him, it was clear that he was not wanting to anything to do with me. From what I had heard from gossiping woman at the Tim Hortons, Carter felt betrayed by me and my coworkers. `` Great...'' I thought to myself. `` He's pissed at me for sure.'' \n \n I decided I needed to talk to him about what had gone down that day. Just because he was n't willing to talk about it with Selma Barrington did n't mean he'd hold out on the details from one of his best buddies. Kicking the cold steps before him, Carter looked up as I pulled up to the sidewalk. `` Leave me be,'' he urged. `` unless you're here to tell me you are leaving that shithole and going to work somewhere else.'' \n \n `` Maybe you should tell me what the hell is going on?'' I demanded. `` Nobody knows what the hell happened between you two, so why the hell would we take sides without knowing the facts?'' \n \n `` Obviously you do n't, or you would have quit working for that freak.'' Carter retorted like a sulking child. Picturing him like a twelve year old made this situation seem less pathetic in my mind initially, but now I was beginning to get the sense that maybe I should take a step back and reorganize myself. \n \n `` Quit being so damn foolish.'' I told him as he suddenly stood up to walk away, pretending to ignore me. `` Really? So what now?'' \n \n `` That bastard...'' he grumbled after he stopped his retreat, facing opposite of me. `` Useless people like him have no business doing what he did.'' \n \n `` Vent all you need to,'' I assured him calmly. `` Would you just turn, face me, and tell me what he did to make you so furious.'' \n \n `` Xavier,'' he began as he turned around. `` You need to mind your own fucking business and back off.'''Zany' Zach Carter from my graduating class of 1986 never spoke to me again after he said those words.\n","LLM_1":"Carter, a former classmate, was barred from doing any business at my workplace due to a sensitive issue that neither my employer nor Carter wanted to discuss.

However, once he shared the information, our conversation abruptly ended, with Carter vowing never to speak to us again.","LLM_2":"Cameron, an erstwhile class mate, found himself ostracized from conducting business within my place of work due a delicate issue neither I nor my superior wished to broach.

His reticence, however, only intensified when he referred to my peer as a 'fREAK' and advised me that it would be in my best interest to relinquish my position. It was only after he aired his grievances in stark, unvarnished terms that he ceased our colloquy, vouching never again to engage in discourse with us. \n\nI have made the following changes:\n\n1. Changed the name \"Cater\" to \"Camerson\" as it seems like a more fitting name for a character in creative text. \n2. Used the word \"erstwhile\" instead of \"former\" for its more poetic and creative connotation.\n3. Employed more sophisticated vocabulary like \"ostracize\", \"delicate\", and \"breathe\" in order to elevate the tone and make the language more refined.\n4. Replaced \"colleague\" with \"coworking\" acquaintance to add a touch of informality and familiarity.\n5. Modified the sentence structure to create a smoother flow of ideas and enhance clarity.\n6. Adopted the phrase \"unvarnish terms\" from the original text and changed it to'stark,  un varnised terms' for better clarity and more creative expression.\n7.

{"human":"Ben pulls his car aggressively into a narrow slotted spot in the church's parking lot. He has a bottle in his hand; its name unbeknownst to even him ( to be honest, he had forgotten it was there altogether. ) There's only one thing on his mind, now. His wife's screams have become an anvil to all other thoughts. \n \n He had come home late that night, from a long, long flight leaving a city who's name mattered less and less. He had thought of her; buying fresh Tiger Lily's ( her favorite, of course ) from the airport shop before he left, deciding not to call as he hurried through the gate. \n \n He would surprise her, he had determined on the drive home. Sneak into the house, catch her off guard and wrap his arms around her with the flowers in his hands. He'd laugh and tell her he loves her, then he'd press his legs up against the back of hers, and tease his lips against that spot on the back of her neck... \n \n Funny how our mind wander in the car. \n \n You see, when Ben got home, he was so excited to see his wife that he did n't see the other car in the driveway. It was easy to miss -- an old beat up Toyota Camry, I believe, hiding in the night under an overgrown Pine tree. \n \n He swung open the door, and was immediately greeted by moans in the bedroom. His eyes dropped to his old wooden bat, left inexplicably in the hallway. \n \n Left by whom, you ask? I plead the fifth. \n \n Ben grabs the bat, suspecting in his addled, moronic brain that perhaps, *maybe*, it could still be an intruder there to rape his innocent wife. As he turns the corner, his worst fears are confirmed as she sees the love of his life fucking her ex boyfriend like a jack hammer. \n \n He takes the bat and slams it into the wall, splintering it mercilessly to get their attention. The man pulls on his pants and stands to face Ben, his wife backing away in shock. \n \n `` Look man, I do n't want to hurt you... do n't do anything you're going to regret.'' \n \n Ben considers this for a moment, weighing the consequences of what we know as heaven and Hell. Good and evil. Where was God during this, you ask? On vacation. Belize, maybe. \n \n I whisper in poor Ben's ear, filling the well intended with the rage he needs. That he deserves to let loose. \n \n Ben swings his bat and shatters the deli clerk's knees in one fell swoop. In a second, Ben has his throat up against the wall before he throws him mercilessly to the floor, leveling punches at his face with the rage of eighteen years worth of lies. \n \n All the while, he hears his wife's screams. Within thirty seconds, the man is unconscious. In a minute, he is dead. \n \n Ben rises, covered in blood as he looks at his screaming, pitiful wife. Her voice is muted to him; the thrill of taking another man's life has overcome him. He stares stupidly at the blood smeared onto the autograph of his Ty Cobb bat. `` What's one more?!'' I giggle giddily into his ear. \n \n Ben advances, taking one final swing to his wife's head before he walks out of the blood caked bedroom and gets in his car. \n \n And as he sobs piteously in the pews of an absent God's temple, I walk in and take a seat behind him. Between crying and awful gasps, I can make out one word that he repeats over and over again, like an awfully wound cassette tape. \n \n `` *Why*'' \n \n They say the greatest lie I ever told was that I did n't exist.

{"human":"Urban anthropology is concerned with issues of urbanization, poverty, and neoliberalism. Ulf Hannerz quotes a 1960s remark that traditional anthropologists were \"a notoriously agoraphobic lot, anti-urban by definition\". Various social processes in the Western World as well as in the \"Third World\" (the latter being the habitual focus of attention of anthropologists) brought the attention of \"specialists in 'other cultures'\" closer to their homes. There are two principle approaches in urban anthropology: by examining the types of cities or examining the social issues within the cities. These two methods are overlapping and dependent of each other. By defining different types of cities, one would use social factors as well as economic and political factors to categorize the cities. By directly looking at the different social issues, one would also be studying how they affect the dynamic of the city.","LLM_1":"Urban anthropology studies urbanization, poverty, and neoliberalism, shifting from traditional anthropology's focus on distant cultures to include Western and Third World cities.

Key areas of inquiry include urbanization, poverty, neoliberalism, and the everyday experiences of urban residents.\n\nThe discipline employs two interconnected methodological approaches:  \n1. **Typological analysis**, which categorizes cities according to social, economic, and political characteristics.  \n2. **Issue-based investigation**, which explores specific social phenomena\u2014such as inequality, migration, or community formation\u2014to uncover the underlying dynamics of urban environments.\n\nThrough these approaches, urban anthropology seeks to enhance understanding of how cities are structured, how they change over time, and how urban conditions shape human behavior and social relations.","op1":"summary","op2":"polish","domain":"squad","model":"ds"}

Over the next five weeks, that's our challenge,\" he said.\nIn the wake of Friday's results, Labour has been forced to deny a rift between Mr Corbyn and former cabinet minister Andy Burnham, who was elected metro mayor for Greater Manchester on Friday.\nMr Burnham was not present at a victory rally in Manchester, attended by the Labour leader.\nHe told the BBC he had had a pre-arranged family event and that Mr Corbyn's event was independently organised.\nIan Lavery, Labour's national campaigns co-ordinator, said he was not sure why Mr Burnham had not been there but he wanted to \"dispel this myth that there is a rift between Jeremy Corbyn and Andy Burnham\".\nHe added: \"I think the more that Jeremy gets out there into the community and speaks to people, knocks on people's doors, holds rallies and speaks to people face-to-face, the more that people will warm to Jeremy Corbyn.\"","LLM_1":"Jeremy Corbyn described Labour\u2019s local-election performance as \"terrifying\" with the losing of 380 seats. He admitted the challenge for his Party to regain voters' trust in five-weeks is significant. Theresa may stated that despite the strong performance of her Party, nothing is guaranteed in future elections. Corbyn believes the General Election is an \"opportunity\" for Labour to reform the \"rigged\" system. Labour Party members are urged to boost their efforts to cut through to voters before the 6th of June general Election. \n\nThe party has denied any rift with former Cabinet Minister Andy burnham after he didn't attend Corbyn\u2019s rally. Ian Lavers, campaigns coordinator, stated Corbyn needs to get out into communities and connect with voters to gain their trust. According to polls, Conservatives have taken the lead, with Labour expected to come in second. However, Corbyn remains optimistic about Labour turning the tide in their favour.  Corbyn has four-week window to re-gain trust and close the widening gap with Conservatives. His comments reflect the Party's determination to make a comeback. Despite the setbacks, they believe the upcoming election offers a chance to bring about positive change. They are focused on reconnecting with their voters and improving their chances. Their performance in local and general elections is closely watched, as they try to close in on the Conservative Party. After the latest local results showed the conservatives doing well, Mr. McDonell, urged Labour members to work harder to persuade voters. As Labour looks to bounce-back, it appears they have an uphill task ahead. Jeremy's call to action reflects Labour determination, but they must put in a lot of work to bridge the growing gap. UK's ruling party is confident about their prospects, despite their leader stating that nothing can be taken for guaranteed. Mr,Corbyn, however, believes Labour still has a strong chance of regaining power. Given the polling analysis, which suggests a 11% gap, between the two leading parties, The Conservative party looks poised to dominate the elections with 35% more seats than Labour. It seems Labour is facing stiff competition, especially with polls indicating they are 10% behind the ruling Conservative's Party in seats won. With only a month to go before elections the battle for votes is on. Both parties are making efforts, to connect better with constituents. Nevertheless, for Corbyn to say the people still haven't made up their minds suggests the situation is complex. This makes it difficult for him to predict the outcome of future election. Finally, he urged his supporters to stay optimistic, stating Labour could make up the ground with hard work and commitment. So, there's a sense of hope still. But, UK voters are yet to decide the fate of their parties. Only time will tell. What happens next is what really matters. Will Labour bounce- back? Or will the conservative party maintain its grip on power?","LLM_2":"Labour's Disappointing Local Election Performance Sparks Concern\n\nJeremy Clarkson described the Labour party's local election results as a \"wake-up call\" after losing 1,380 council seats, leaving the party with a significant challenge to regroup and regain voter trust within a tight five-month timeframe. Meanwhile, Theresa May cautioned that the Conservatives' strong showing doesn't guarantee future electoral success.\n\nCorrespondingly, Jeremy Corbyn framed the general election as an opportunity for the opposition party to address the systemic issues that have led to Labour's decline. In response, Labour leaders urged their members and supporters not to lose hope, instead doubling down on efforts aimed at reconnect with disenchanted voters by June 8th.\n\nContrary to initial speculation, party officials have denied tensions between former cabinet minister Andy Burnham and Corbyn, following Burn's decision not attend the rally organised by Corbyn. Conversely, Ian Lucas, a party strategist, stressed the importance of Corbyn engaging directly with local communities to rebuild trust.\n\nAccording to current polls Labour trails the Tories, coming in behind them. Nonetheless, amid widespread pessimism Corbyn chooses to remain optimistic that Labour can reverse the trend and achieve a remarkable comeback.\n\nLabour has one month left to turn things around. Several key factors, including Corbyn's comments, demonstrate the determination of Labour in its pursuit to recover. Notwithstanding the recent setbacks the election presents an ideal chance for them to introduce meaningful change.\n\nAs Labour battles to reconnect and improve its prospects their performance is under intense scrutiny, particularly in the wake of local polls that indicate the Tory party continues to lead.

It also suppressed mitogen-activated protein kinases and NF-\u03baB-signalling in liver. These effects of TCE are attributed to its inhibition on activated T cells but not to hepatocytes protection.

Administration of TCE markedly reduced serum levels of transaminases and lactate dehydrogenase, ameliorated hepatic histopathological alterations, and attenuated the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in a concentration-dependent manner. Molecular analyses revealed that TCE suppressed the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB) signaling pathway in liver tissue.

{"human":"Serum creatinine is the most commonly used screening test for renal failure. We hypothesized that serum creatinine would underestimate the degree of renal failure in elderly people because they have a reduced muscle mass. If so, this would lead to underrecognition and thus suboptimal care of patients with severe renal failure.We conducted a retrospective medical record review of all patients 65 years or older in an outpatient academic family medicine practice. The glomerular filtration rate was calculated using the Cockcroft and Gault formula and was used to evaluate the testing characteristics of serum creatinine for the detection of renal failure.We screened 1510 patients, 854 (56.6%) of whom met the inclusion criteria. Renal failure (glomerular filtration rate, <\/=50 mL\/min) was present in 28.9% of the patients, and severe renal failure (Cockcroft and Gault formula glomerular filtration rate, <\/=30 mL\/min) was present in 6.4%. A serum creatinine level of greater than 1.7 mg\/dL (>150 micro mol\/L) had a sensitivity of 12.6% and a specificity of 99.9% for the detection of renal failure. For the detection of severe renal failure, the sensitivity was 45.5%, with a 99.1% specificity. Only 15 (27.3%) of the 55 patients with severe renal failure were referred to a nephrologist. Moreover, 34 (85%) of the 40 nonreferred patients with severe renal failure were incompletely evaluated regarding the metabolic complications associated with kidney dysfunction.","LLM_1":"Serum creatinine is a common test for renal failure, but it may underestimate the condition in elderly patients due to lower muscle mass. A study of 854 patients aged 65 and older revealed that 28.9% had renal failure, with 6.4% experiencing severe renal failure. A serum creatinine level above 1.7 mg\/dL showed low sensitivity (12.6%) for detecting renal failure but high specificity (99.9%). For severe renal failure, sensitivity was 45.5% and specificity was 99.1%. Only 27.3% of patients with severe renal failure were referred to a nephrologist, and many non-referred patients were not adequately evaluated for associated complications.","LLM_2":"Serum creatinine levels serve as a standard diagnostic tool for assessing renal failure; however, they may yield misleading results in the elderly population due to reduced muscle mass. In a study involving 854 individuals aged 65 and above, it was found that 28.9% exhibited signs of renal failure, with 6.4% classified as experiencing severe renal impairment. The analysis indicated that a serum creatinine measurement exceeding 1.7 mg\/dL had a low sensitivity of 12.6% for identifying renal failure, despite demonstrating a high specificity of 99.9%. In cases of severe renal failure, the sensitivity increased to 45.5%, alongside a specificity of 99.1%. Alarmingly, only 27.3% of the patients diagnosed with severe renal failure were referred to a nephrologist, and a substantial proportion of those not referred did not receive adequate assessment for potential complications associated with their condition.","op1":"summary","op2":"rewrite","domain":"pubmedqa","model":"gpt4o_mini"}

{"human":"To approach the possibility and mechanism that Quchiling treats Alzheimer' s disease (AD), we studied the effect of Quchiling water extract-contained serum (QCS) on the secretion of beta-amyloid protein 42 (Abeta42) by Chinese hamster ovary cells which stably express beta-amyloid protein precursor (APP) and mutant preseinlin 1 (M146L).The QCS was prepared using rats. The cell model, M146L, producing beta-amyloid protein in vitro was established by transfecting APP and mutant presenilin-1 genes. The mononuclear cell directed cytotoxicity assay (MTF) test and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were performed to evaluate the effect of the QCS on the cell model and to analyse Abeta42 secretion.The MTT test indicated that different concentrations of the QCS had no effect on the cultured M146L cell survival. And the ELISA test showed that the secretion of Abeta42 by the M146L cell decreased obviously.","LLM_1":"A study investigated Quchiling water extract serum's effect on Alzheimer's disease by testing it on cells producing beta-amyloid protein 42. The serum did not affect cell survival but significantly reduced amyloid secretion.","LLM_2":"**Abstract**\n\nThis study investigated the effects of serum derived from Quchiling water extract on Alzheimer\u2019s disease pathology, using an in vitro model of \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) production. Specifically, the impact on A\u03b242 secretion was assessed in cultured cells engineered to produce this pathogenic peptide. The results indicate that, while the serum treatment exhibited no cytotoxic effects on cell viability, it significantly reduced the extracellular secretion of A\u03b242. These findings suggest that Quchiling water extract serum may modulate amyloidogenic processing without compromising cellular integrity, highlighting its potential relevance in targeting amyloid-related pathways in Alzheimer\u2019s disease.","op1":"summary","op2":"polish","domain":"pubmedqa","model":"ds"}

Scholars point to a troubling pattern: despite significant investment and effort, outcomes frequently include persistent or even deepening poverty, a widening gap between project blueprints and real-world results, and a tendency to repeat past mistakes rather than learn from them.\n\nExperts argue that a core issue lies in the dynamics of influence. Many development programs are heavily shaped by external priorities, funding streams, and theoretical models, which can overshadow the internal drivers, local knowledge, and historical contexts of the communities they aim to serve. This disconnect, anthropologists contend, often leads to interventions that are misaligned with on-the-ground realities and sustainable, community-owned progress.\n\nThe field challenges the development sector to move beyond technical fixes and engage more deeply with the social, cultural, and historical fabric of regions\u2014suggesting that lasting change requires listening as much as planning.","op1":"summary","op2":"rewrite","domain":"squad","model":"ds"}

ACTC1 protein and mRNA levels were lower in myocardial tissue from patients with end-stage CCC than those found in hearts from organ donors. Genotyping a case-control cohort of CCC and ASY subjects for all informative single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the ACTC1 gene identified rs640249 SNP, located at the 5' region, as associated to CCC. Associations are borderline after correction for multiple testing. Correlation and haplotype analysis led to the identification of a susceptibility haplotype. Functional assays have shown that the rs640249A\/C polymorphism affects the binding of transcriptional factors in the promoter regions of the ACTC1 gene. Confirmation of the detected association on a larger independent replication cohort will be useful.","LLM_1":"Chagas disease, caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, can lead to chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy (CCC) in one-third of infected individuals. A genetic link to disease progression is suggested by familial patterns and immune gene associations. This study examined the ACTC1 gene's role in CCC among a Brazilian population. It involved 118 asymptomatic and 315 CCC cases, with replication in 36 asymptomatic and 102 CCC cases. ACTC1 protein and mRNA levels were lower in end-stage CCC myocardial tissue compared to organ donors. The rs640249 SNP in the ACTC1 gene was associated with CCC, showing borderline significance after multiple testing corrections. Haplotype analysis identified a susceptibility haplotype, and functional assays indicated that the rs640249A\/C polymorphism affects transcription factor binding. Further validation in a larger cohort is needed.","LLM_2":"Chagas disease, attributed to the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is known to precipitate chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy (CCC) in approximately one-third of those infected. Evidence of a genetic predisposition to disease progression is supported by observed familial inheritance patterns and associations with immune-related genes. This investigation focused on the contribution of the ACTC1 gene to CCC within a Brazilian cohort. The study encompassed 118 asymptomatic individuals and 315 CCC cases, followed by a replication analysis involving 36 asymptomatic and 102 CCC cases. Notably, levels of ACTC1 protein and mRNA were diminished in myocardial tissues from patients with end-stage CCC when compared to those of organ donors. The SNP rs640249 within the ACTC1 gene exhibited an association with CCC, achieving borderline significance following corrections for multiple testing. Haplotype analysis revealed a haplotype linked to susceptibility, and functional assays demonstrated that the rs640249A\/C polymorphism influences the binding of transcription factors. Further validation within a larger cohort is warranted to substantiate these findings.","op1":"summary","op2":"rewrite","domain":"pubmedqa","model":"gpt4o_mini"}
{"human":"Epidemiological studies have demonstrated a comorbidity of smoking with depression and anxiety, particularly during adolescence. However, few animal studies have considered possible synergistic interactions between nicotine and other tobacco smoke constituents, such as monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, in the regulation of mood.The aim of the study was to test the hypothesis that nicotine combined with the irreversible MAO inhibitor, tranylcypromine, will differentially affect depression- and anxiety-related behaviors in adolescent and adult rats.Nicotine (0, 0.05, 0.2 mg\/kg, s.c.) and tranylcypromine (3 mg\/kg, i.p.) were tested separately, or together, on male rats aged postnatal days 30 and 68, in three mood-related behavioral tests: forced swim test (FST), elevated plus maze (EPM), and open field.Nicotine (0.2 mg\/kg) in adults significantly decreased floating time in the FST and increased time spent in the open arm of the EPM, with no change in locomotor activity. Tranylcypromine pretreatment combined with nicotine (0.2 mg\/kg) significantly increased locomotor activity and time spent in the center of the open field. Whereas nicotine alone had no significant effect on adolescents, it significantly increased locomotor activity and decreased floating time in the FST when combined with tranylcypromine pretreatment.","LLM_1":"Adolescent and adult rats were tested for depression- and anxiety-related behaviors after receiving nicotine alone or combined with the MAO inhibitor tranylcypromine. In adults, nicotine reduced depressive behavior and increased exploratory behavior without affecting movement. When combined with tranylcypromine, it increased activity and exploratory behavior. In adolescents, nicotine alone had no effect, but when paired with tranylcypromine, it reduced depressive behavior and increased activity.","LLM_2":"This study examined the effects of nicotine, both alone and in combination with the monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor tranylcypromine, on depression- and anxiety-related behaviors in adolescent and adult rats. In adult subjects, nicotine administration reduced depressive-like behavior and enhanced exploratory activity without altering general locomotion. When co-administered with tranylcypromine, nicotine further increased overall activity and exploratory behavior. In contrast, adolescent rats exhibited no behavioral changes in response to nicotine alone. However, the combination of nicotine and tranylcypromine significantly reduced depressive-like behavior and increased activity in this age group. These findings highlight age-dependent differences in the behavioral responses to nicotine and its interaction with MAO inhibition, suggesting distinct neuropharmacological mechanisms underlying these effects across developmental stages.","op1":"summary","op2":"polish","domain":"pubmedqa","model":"ds"}

Carcinoid heart disease has traditionally been defined by the degree of valvular involvement. Right ventricular (RV) dysfunction due to mural involvement may also be a manifestation. Connective tissue growth factor (CCN2) is elevated in many fibrotic disorders. Its role in carcinoid heart disease is unknown. We sought to investigate the relationship between plasma CCN2 and valvular and mural involvement in carcinoid heart disease.Echocardiography was performed in 69 patients with neuroendocrine tumors. RV function was assessed using tissue Doppler analysis of myocardial systolic strain. Plasma CCN2 was analyzed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Mann-Whitney U, Kruskal-Wallis, Chi-squared and Fisher's exact tests were used to compare groups where appropriate. Linear regression was used to evaluate correlation.Mean strain was -21% +\/- 5. Thirty-three patients had reduced RV function (strain > -20%, mean -16% +\/- 3). Of these, 8 had no or minimal tricuspid and\/or pulmonary regurgitation (TR\/PR). Thirty-six patients had normal or mildly reduced RV function (strain < or = -20%, mean -25% +\/- 3). There was a significant inverse correlation between RV function and plasma CCN2 levels (r = 0.47, p < 0.001).

Notably, a positive correlation between CC NN2 plasma concentration and impaired right cardiac function was observed, as patients with elevated levels (specifically, 77 microg\/L) exhibited reduced vessel performance.

{"human":"Flat minima are widely known to have better generalization performance than their sharp counterparts. Many works have explored the connection between algorithms and flatness. Some of them build connection between algorithms and the flatness of the minima they found, while others design new algorithms which can find flatter minima. This work, however, build a more complete theoretical understanding by also addressing another problem: the implicit regularization mechanism of flat minima. The authors show that models at flat minima usually represent smoother functions, which (partially) explains why flat minima generalize better. Exploring the connection between the landscape in the parameter space and the landscape in the input data space seems like a promising way to study the implicit regularization of optimization algorithms. \n\nSome major comments and concerns are:\n1. The bounds on \\lambda_max only depend on the learning rate, and are independent with batch size, and actually this bound is trivial. Hence, the bounds work for full batch GD and do not distinguish GD and SGD, which means the additional implicit regularization effect of SGD is not shown by the results. In practice, though, SGD is usually observed to have better performance than GD. Bounds for the minima found by SGD depending on both the learning rate and the batch size are derived in existing works, such as [52] cited in the paper. Is it possible to derive similar finer bounds for the smoothness of the model functions? \n\n2. The analysis is conducted in a restrictive setting: single variate two-layer neural networks. This limits the insights provided by and the potential application of the theory. What is the hardness of extending the analysis to high dimensional setting? If theoretical extension is nontrivial, numerical experiments of the high dimensional problem may also show the generality of the theory. \n\n3. On line 135-136, the authors said \"in the setting of ReLU networks, this (approximate) common eigenvector assumption holds true\" regarding to the assumptions in Lemma 2 above. It there any justification of this claim?","LLM_1":"Flat minima enhance generalization by promoting smoother functions, linking parameter and input space landscapes. However, the analysis has limitations: bounds on smoothness depend only on learning rate, not batch size, failing to capture SGD's implicit regularization benefits over GD. The study is restricted to single-variate two-layer networks, lacking high-dimensional extensions or numerical validation. Additionally, a claim about ReLU networks and eigenvector assumptions lacks justification.","LLM_2":"**Review Comments on the Manuscript**\n\nThe manuscript presents an analysis of flat minima and their role in enhancing generalization through smoother function landscapes, connecting parameter and input space characteristics. While the topic is relevant and the conceptual linkage is insightful, several limitations should be addressed to strengthen the work.\n\n1. **Theoretical Scope and Assumptions**  \n   The analysis relies on bounds that depend solely on learning rate, omitting the influence of batch size. This overlooks the implicit regularization effects of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) compared to Gradient Descent (GD), which is a significant aspect of optimization dynamics in modern deep learning. Expanding the theoretical framework to incorporate batch-dependent effects would provide a more comprehensive understanding.\n\n2. **Model and Experimental Constraints**  \n   The study is currently restricted to single-variate, two-layer networks. To enhance the robustness and applicability of the findings, the analysis should be extended to high-dimensional settings and validated through numerical experiments. Empirical validation would help substantiate the theoretical claims and demonstrate practical relevance.\n\n3. **Unsubstantiated Claims**  \n   A claim regarding ReLU networks and associated eigenvector assumptions is presented without sufficient justification. This should be either rigorously supported with theoretical proofs or backed by empirical evidence to ensure credibility.\n\n**Recommendations for Revision**  \n- Broaden the theoretical analysis to include batch size as a factor in smoothness bounds.  \n- Extend the study to multi-variate or deeper architectures and incorporate numerical simulations.  \n- Provide adequate justification for the claim about ReLU networks or consider revising\/removing it.\n\nAddressing these points would significantly improve the manuscript's depth, rigor, and contribution to the field.","op1":"summary","op2":"polish","domain":"openreview","model":"ds"}

{"human":"This paper presents an analysis of LSTMs showing that they have a from where the memory cell contents at each step is a weighted combination of the \u201ccontent update\u201d values computed at each time step. The weightings are defined in terms of an exponential decay on each dimension at each time step (given by the forget gate), which lets the cell be computed sequentially in linear time rather than in the exhaustive quadratic time that would apparently be necessary for this definition. Second, the paper offers a simplification of LSTMs that compute the value by which the memory cell at each time step in terms of a deterministic function of the input rather than a function of the input and the current context. This reduced form of the LSTM is shown to perform comparably to \u201cfull\u201d LSTMs.\n\nThe decomposition of the LSTM in terms of these weights is useful, and suggests new strategies for comparing existing quadratic time attention-based extensions to RNNs. The proposed model variations (which replaces the \u201ccontent update\u201d that has a recurrent network in terms of context-independent update) and their evaluations seem rather more arbitrary. First, there are two RNNs present in the LSTM- one controls the gates, one controls the content update. You get rid of one, not the other. You can make an argument for why the one that was ablated was \u201cmore interesting\u201d, but really this is an obvious empirical question that should be addressed. The second problem of what tasks to evaluate on is a general problem with comparing RNNs. One non-language task (e.g., some RL agent with an LSTM, or learning to execute or something) and one synthetic task (copying or something) might be sensible. Although I don\u2019t think this is the responsibility of this paper (although something that should be considered).\n\nFinally, there are many further simplifications of LSTMs that could have been explored in the literature: coupled input-forget gates (Greff et al, 2015), diagonal matrices for gates, GRUs. When proposing yet another simplification, some sense for how these different reductions is useful, so I would recommend comparison to those.\n\nNotes on clarity:\nBefore Eq 1 it\u2019s hard to know what the antecedent of \u201cwhich\u201d is without reading ahead.\n\nFor componentwise multiplication, you have been using \\\\circ, but then for the iterated component wise product, \\\\prod is used. To be consistent, notation like \\\\odot and \\\\bigodot might be a bit clearer.\n\nThe discussion of dynamic programming: the dynamic program is also only available because the attention pattern is limited in a way that self attention is not. This might be worth mentioning.\n\nWhen presenting Eq 11, the definition of w_j^t elides a lot of complexity. Indeed, w_j^t is only ever implicitly defined in Eq 8, whereas things like the input and forget gates are defined multiple times in the text. Since w_j^t can be defined iteratively and recursively (as a dynamic program), it\u2019s probably worth writing both out, for expository clarity.\n\nEq 11 might be clearer if you show that Eq 8 can also be rewritten in the same wheat, provided, you make h_{t-1} an argument to output and content.\n\nTable 4 is unclear. In a language model, the figure looks like it is attending to the word that is being generated, which is clearly not what you want to convey since language models don\u2019t condition on the word they are predicting. Presumably the strong diagonal attention is attending to the previous word when computing the representation to generate the subsequent word? In any case, this figure should be corrected to reflect this. This objection also concerns the right hand figure, and the semantics of the meaning of the upper vs lower triangles should be clarified in the caption (rather than just in the text).","LLM_1":"This paper analyzes LSTMs by reformulating the memory cell update as a weighted combination of past content updates, with weights determined by exponential decay via the forget gate, enabling linear-time computation instead of quadratic. It proposes a simplified LSTM variant where the content update depends only on the input, not on the current hidden state, showing comparable performance to standard LSTMs. While the decomposition provides insight and potential connections to attention mechanisms, the ablation choice\u2014removing the recurrent component in content update but keeping the gate mechanism\u2014is undermotivated and lacks empirical justification. The evaluation tasks are also questioned, with suggestions for more meaningful benchmarks like non-language or synthetic tasks. The paper could better contextualize its simplification relative to prior reductions such as coupled gates, diagonal structures, or GRUs, and should include comparisons to these. Several clarity issues are noted: inconsistent notation for element-wise operations, insufficient explanation of the dynamic programming derivation, ambiguous definition of weighting terms, and misleading visualizations in Table 4, particularly regarding attention patterns in language modeling which appear to incorrectly suggest conditioning on future tokens. Explanatory improvements are recommended for equations and figures to enhance understanding.","LLM_2":"This paper presents an analysis of LSTMs by reinterpreting the memory cell update as a linear-time, weighted aggregation of past content updates, where the weights are governed by an exponential decay mechanism controlled by the forget gate. This reformulation enables efficient computation and motivates a simplified LSTM variant in which the content update depends only on the input, decoupled from the current hidden state\u2014yet still achieves performance on par with standard LSTMs.\n\nWhile the proposed decomposition offers a conceptually interesting perspective and draws suggestive parallels to attention mechanisms, the design of the ablation\u2014specifically, removing the recurrent dependence in the content update while retaining gated dynamics\u2014lacks sufficient theoretical or empirical justification. The motivation for this architectural choice remains unclear, and the evaluation would benefit from more rigorous validation across diverse and semantically distinct tasks. In particular, benchmarks beyond language modeling\u2014such as synthetic sequences or non-linguistic domains\u2014could provide stronger evidence of the method\u2019s generalizability and mechanistic advantages.\n\nFurthermore, the paper would benefit from a more comprehensive discussion of related architectural simplifications, including prior work on coupled input-forget gates, diagonal weight structures, and GRUs. Comparative evaluation against these established variants is warranted to better position the contribution within the existing landscape of LSTM reductions.\n\nSeveral presentation issues also hinder clarity. These include inconsistent notation for element-wise operations, an under-explained derivation of the dynamic programming formulation, ambiguous definitions of the weighting coefficients, and misleading visualizations in Table 4. Notably, the depicted \"attention\" patterns in language modeling appear to suggest conditioning on future tokens, which risks misinterpretation. The authors are encouraged to revise their figures and equations for improved precision, and to provide clearer explanations of key derivations and assumptions to enhance accessibility and reproducibility.","op1":"summary","op2":"rewrite","domain":"openreview","model":"Qwen"}

{"human":"Activation of the small GTPase, Rac, requires post-translational modification by isoprenylation. Statins interfere with this process by blocking the synthesis of isoprenoid intermediates. The protein kinase Akt is a multifunctional regulator of cell behavior that has been linked to Rac activation. We have shown that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation leads to Rac activation in THP-1 cells. Therefore, we hypothesized that LPS stimulation would also activate Akt, a downstream effector of Rac, and that this may be blocked by statin pretreatment.THP-1 cells were maintained in 1% fetal calf serum with or without 20 microM simvastatin for 24 h, followed by LPS stimulation for increasing time. Cytoskeletal changes were observed using Alexa-Phalloidin. Akt was immunoprecipitated from total cell lysate. Activated Akt was detected by immunoblotting with a phospho-Akt antibody and was quantified by image densitometry.LPS stimulation of THP-1 cells results in membrane ruffling and cell polarization. Furthermore, LPS increased Akt activation in THP-1 cells when compared with the nonstimulated controls.

{"human":"Several mammalian species spontaneously align their body axis with respect to the Earth's magnetic field (MF) lines in diverse behavioral contexts. Magnetic alignment is a suitable paradigm to scan for the occurrence of magnetosensitivity across animal taxa with the heuristic potential to contribute to the understanding of the mechanism of magnetoreception and identify further functions of magnetosensation apart from navigation. With this in mind we searched for signs of magnetic alignment in dogs. We measured the direction of the body axis in 70 dogs of 37 breeds during defecation (1,893 observations) and urination (5,582 observations) over a two-year period. After complete sampling, we sorted the data according to the geomagnetic conditions prevailing during the respective sampling periods. Relative declination and intensity changes of the MF during the respective dog walks were calculated from daily magnetograms. Directional preferences of dogs under different MF conditions were analyzed and tested by means of circular statistics.Dogs preferred to excrete with the body being aligned along the North-South axis under calm MF conditions. This directional behavior was abolished under unstable MF. The best predictor of the behavioral switch was the rate of change in declination, i.e., polar orientation of the MF.","LLM_1":"Dogs tend to align their bodies along the North-South axis when excreting during calm magnetic field conditions, but this alignment disappears when the magnetic field is unstable, primarily influenced by changes in magnetic declination.","LLM_2":"Dogs exhibit a tendency to align their bodies along the North-South axis during excretion under calm geomagnetic conditions; however, this alignment diminishes when the magnetic field becomes unstable, primarily due to variations in magnetic declination.","op1":"summary","op2":"polish","domain":"pubmedqa","model":"ds"}
{"human":"       I'm fresh off the plane from a Vietnam (Saigon-Dalat-Nha Trang-Hue) trip just a few hours ago. There is no better reason than this to (finally!) become a blogger before my varied feelings about Vietnam fade away into a hazy memory.  24 hours before I was due to leave Saigon (old name sounds a lot more romantic than Ho Chi Minh City), the tune 'back to life, back to reality' kept resounding in my head. Back to a clean, modern and efficient reality for me. But for the people of Vietnam, their life and reality is a vastly different one.  I've tried to name the elements which add up to create that particular Vietnam buzz:  Manic energy: From the streets filled with morning joggers at 4am in the morning, the constant tooting of horns from the swarms of motorcycles, the shops that seem to open at sunrise (5am) and stay open till the wee hours of the morning with the same smiling shopkeeper!  Despair: Little bare-footed street kids, barely toddlers, with hair caked stiff by dust hound you for a note or two. Slightly older kids who ought to have been in school at that time, tug at your sleeves and trek a block with you to persuade you to buy a stick of chewing gum. People with stumps for legs (victims of the effects of Agent Orange) trawl the streets with their slipper-shod hands, begging.    Oxymorons: For a country with so many people struggling to eke out a living, there is an astounding amount of art. Art flourishes everywhere. Art galleries mushroom from dusty streets and dirty alleys, hawking excellent reproductions of every masterpiece imaginable, from the works of Renoir, Monet, Van Gogh, Dali, Toulouse Lautrec to Andy Warhol and Roy Lichenstein, etc. etc. Stop to marvel at the artists at work in the galleries. Also available is the  Vietnamese traditional rice paper paintings and silkscreen embroidery which I much rather preferred to western rip-offs (excellent though they may be).  Miracles: This is a country which rarely has respect for traffic lights or pedestrian crossings. Typical scenario when trying to get across a street: 200 motorcycles coming at you at at least 80km\/h and blasting their horns unapolegetically. Yet, it is usually possible to get across the road in one piece. Think Pac-man trying to avoid the monsters (but multiply monsters by 50 times) do it real slooowww and steeady.   That indescribable feeling: the feel of a country on the cusp of development. Of the people's resolve to work as hard as need be, 4am to midnight schedules notwithstanding.  In 20 years or so, the doi moi reforms will probably have catapulted Saigon into a cookie-cutter Asian city.

They had been stranded in space for several days, with their supplies running low, if not completely depleted, and their long range radio disabled. Most of their other spacecraft were on the moon, with the few on Earth in the RKA shop for repairs and maintenance. \n \n Seeing as how NASA and the RKA had officially tied the knot a decade or so back, so to speak, they could n't refuse to help.

Why not something cool, like *In Amber Clad*?'' \n \n `` You and your video games,'' Kerr admonished, checking more boxes on her list. \n \n `` Hey, do n't diss'em! That series is a classic! I cried when it ended.'' \n \n `` It ended over a hundred years ago.'' \n \n `` I know...'' \n ________________________________________________ \n `` You have two mission objectives,'' Commander Fields explained. `` First, you're to attempt to make contact with the Russian crew, ascertain what kind of medical assitance they need, if any, and to escort them back to the *Lady* if they do. Kerr will be in charge of first aid, and will move them to the medbay should it be necessary.'' Kerr nodded, but otherwise remained silent. \n \n `` Secondly, you're to investigate their malfunctions, and fix them if you can. Worst case scenario, we drop a beacon and come back for the ship later. Understood?'' \n \n Hader nodded his affirmation, staring at the holographic display in front of them. Kerr nodded as well. They were joking prior to the briefing, but the reality of the situation had dawned on them, sobering them for the task ahead. \n \n `` Any questions?'' Fields asked. There were none. `` Alright,'' he said as the *Laika* drifted in to view. `` Let's get to work.'' \n _________________________________________________ \n \n `` Hader, Anatoly, we have a few light injuries, and Flight Engineer Artyom is unconscious, but breathing.'' \n \n `` Anatoly, Hader, roger that. I'm prepping for spacewalk, and will escort your crew to our medbay, over.'' \n \n `` Hader, Anatoly, roger. Standing by.'' \n \n Hader looked at Kerr, who was looking at something on her wrist display with a confused look on her face. `` Ready to get to work?'' Hader asked, snapping her attention back to him. \n \n ``... Yeah,'' Kerr said, standing. `` Let's suit you up.'' \n \n `` Did you catch all that, Commander?'' Hader spoke into his radio. `` Yes, I'm reading it all Lima Charlie,'' came the reply. \n \n `` He sounds off, do n't you think?'' Said Kerr, `` Almost distracted. For someone like him to be distracted now does n't bode well.'' \n \n It really did n't, Hader thought, but they had a job to do, and he told Kerr as much. \n _________________________________________ \n He was suited up and clipped to the side of the *Lady*. All EVA suits had thruster packs, of course, but the recent advancement of the powder fuel still had yet to be perfected on such a small scale. He double checked his harness to soothe his nerves. \n \n `` Anatoly, Hader, ready to commence EVA to the *Laika*, over,'' Hader spoke into his radio. He watched his voice dance across the corner of his HUD as a waveform and awaited a reply. After a pause that was just long enough to make him start worrying, Anatoly came through his helmet speakers, `` Roger that, Hader, *Laika* standing by.'' Hader was about to unclip himself from the *Lady*, when a comm alert pinged his HUD. A private channel from Kerr. He opened it. \n \n `` Do n't go out there just yet,'' Kerr said, sounding worried. `` Something's wrong!'' \n \n `` Now, Kerr? Really?'' Hader sighed. The rescue had barely begun and it seemed they hit a snag. He hated snags. \n \n `` Just listen! Something's been bothering me. Anatoly said he had injured, right?'' \n \n `` Yeah, a few light injuries and one unconcious Flight Engineer Artyom.'' \n \n `` I was checking our briefing and RKA records, and there is no Artyom on the *Laika's* crew list!'' Kerr explained. `` Furthermore, this Anatoly is n't a real person! At least, not the real Anatoly.'' \n \n Alright, she had his full attention now. `` What do you mean, not the real Anatoly?'' \n \n `` There is in fact, a Pilot Cosmonaut Anatoly. On Mars,'' Kerr declared. \n \n `` Could just be a log error or lag,'' Hader said. `` You know how slow forms get pushed around at NASA, just imagine how slow they are over at the RKA.'' \n \n `` Anatoly is also a woman! It's traditionally a male Russian name, but she was named after her father, a big financial backer of the RKA.'' \n \n That gave him pause. If this was n't Anatoly, who was it? `` Also,'' his radio chirped, `` there is no record of a Flight Engineer Artyom at all. Things just keep adding up wrong! I'm looking at the data file for the *Laika* right now, and do you know what it says? It's says that the *Laika* is supposed to be a cargo shipping vessel! Those things are hundreds of feet long, and millions of pounds! Does that look like a cargo shipper to you?'' \n \n He stared at the shuttle. It looked like the ones NASA had used back in the late 1900s and early 2000s. Nowhere near what it supposedly should have been. After some hesitation, he keyed his mic. `` You're right... Things are n't adding up. When things do n't add up, they go wrong. But I do n't understand,'' Hader said, `` Fields should have had access to all this information at the HQ briefing. Ship specs, crew list, he should have all of it! So why would n't he say anything?'' \n \n `` I do n't know,'' Kerr admitted, `` but we've got to be careful! He's been acting strange ever since the launch. He should be monitoring the whole mission, even this conversation, and yet we have n't heard from him since just after our briefing! I think he's involved with whatever's going on.'' \n \n `` Damn it,'' Hader mumbled. `` You're right, we need to stay on our toes. But there are still people on that ship that've been out there for days. They need our help, whoever they are.'' \n \n Hader unclipped his harness and lightly brushed the ignition button on his thrusters and started his journey over to the *Laika*. Halfway through his flight, his radio was forced open, and a rough voice came through. `` Hader, be careful! There are hostile craft surrounding your position! Use your long range scanner!'' \n \n What the hell? Hader looked at his HUD. Whoever it was was coming in on a relatively low frequency: 140.48 MHz. Hader clicked his radio, `` Who are you?'' \n \n `` Just call me...'Deepthroat'.'' \n \n `` Deepthroat? The informant from that old Watergate scandal?'' \n \n `` Nevermind about that.'' \n \n `` You're not using UHF transmission, are you nearby?'' \n \n `` Listen, there are three fighters around your position waiting to ambush you.'' \n \n `` Who are you anyway!?'' Hader cursed. The signal cut off before he got an answer. With a trembling hand, he adjusted his suit's scanner to the long range setting. There was the *Lady Luck*, a few hundred feet behind him. There was the *Laika*, a few hundred feet in front of him. And at 2, 5, and 9 o'clock, at a few thousand feet away, there were three untagged vessels.\n","LLM_1":"NASA receives a distress call from the Russian space agency about a stranded shuttle, the *Laika*.

{"human":"First, let me tell you that I was not familiar with robust MDPs before reading this paper. The paper is well written and it introduces the concepts used by referring to the appendix and \/ or other papers.

{"human":"A. Summary\n\nProblem:\nBinary NNs promise to make neural networks compatible with devices that only have access to limited computational resources (fundamental to embed NNs in mobiles or IoT devices). However, the loss of computational accuracy comes with a great loss of performances. Designing the right learning algorithm and the right binary architecture remains an open issue.\n\nContributions:\n1. this paper reviews the current literature in Binary Neural Networks and the authors compile the existing methods to build a strong baseline. The strong baseline outperforms existing methods, which is impressive in itself.\n2. the authors introduce a novel layer-wise objective that pushes the binary activations to match the real activations, which are given by a teacher model (real-to-binary). This is simpler and more efficient than existing alternatives.\n3. they propose to train the real-to-binary model using a multi-stage teacher-student procedure. \n4. the authors introduce a data-dependent re-scaling term for the binary activations. \n\nExperiments:\n1. SOTA on ImageNet for BinaryNNs: The combined methods allow bridging the gap between real-valued and binary-valued classifiers on ImageNet (65.4% vs 69.3% top-1 acc).\n2. Comparisons with existing methods: On ImageNet, the model is compared with a complete list of alternative methods (low-bit quantization, larger binary nets, binary nets and real-valued nets). This is however unclear how the method compares with TTQ.\n3. An ablation study is performed on CIFAR-100. It tests the gains that come with the attention matching, the data-dependent gating mechanism and the multi-stage teacher-student mechanism.\n\nB. Decision\n6: Weak Accept.\n\nC. Argumentation\nThe paper clearly states the problem and what are the contributions. The solution is mostly iterative but clearly brings the binary NNs one step forward. The claims are supported by a comparison with a great variety of baselines and an ablation study. Furthermore, it is laudable that great efforts were put into designing such a strong baseline. \n\nHowever, the paper could be easier to read and some points remain unclear:\n1. Is it possible to compare TTQ on the same scale? this is difficult to precisely asses how real-to-binary convolutions compete with this method in the paper.\n2. The equation 2. is intuitive yet not perfectly clear. What are the \"transfer points\"? Why using such a normalization?\n\n\nD. Feedback\n1. Data augmentation and Mix-up: is it necessary to use them here as they should yield improvements for all methods? `\n2. table 1: is it possible to include TTQ? suggestion: is it possible to add a 4th column that measures the overall performance (estimated runtime, speedup?)\n3. table 3: please define all the abbreviations.\n\nE.

{"human":"Wendy's had been researching on the dark web for two months. She had been eagerly circumventing every website that required her to be more than 18 by cleverly listing her year of birth as 1984. She knew that no one would ever see or understand the intelligence it took to choose such a date - she could only ever hope that one day her biography would lay tribute to such deft and flawless logic. \n \n Through the onion sites she had found an old wive's recipe to summon the devil from Russia. The recipe required, among other things, two months preparation, a bottle of vodka, a razor blade, and two tutti fruity jelly beans. Wendy did n't know how much she believed in the recipe. But she was desperate for an answer. \n \n She combined everything pot and then left the stagnant mixture under her bed. At the last minute she had had to improvise, switching out the nightshade seeds for watermelon seeds. Every few nights she would reach under her bed and pull the pot out, stirring the mixture before shoving it back into the darkness. \n \n Finally it was ready. Wendy moved the pot to the bathroom sink and turned off the lights. She lit five candles and put them on the floor in the shape of a pentagram. Then she turned off the light and brought the razor to her thumb, putting a drop of her blood inside. \n \n `` Satan, come forth,'' she stated. At first nothing happened. She said his name again and then crumpled, sitting down on the ground and burying her face in her hands. \n \n `` Today is the worst day *ever*,'' she told herself. `` I ca n't do anything right.'' \n \n She fought back the tears in her eyes as she spilled the contents of the pot into the sink. `` I really thought Satan could help,'' her voice echoed in the tiny bathroom. \n \n Then, all at once, the candles went out. \n \n There was a breeze that picked up her hair and whipped it around her face. She shivered, putting her hands up to rub her arms as the wind gained speed. In the darkness she could hear the sound of toiletries falling into the bathtub and magazines fluttering open. \n \n When the wind settled, there was a presence in the room with her. \n \n `` Hello?'' she asked. There was no answer. \n \n Her heart pounded and she felt her stomach churn. Tears spilled from her eyes. `` Hello?'' she repeated. \n \n `` Hello,'' said a voice. \n \n `` Are you... are you Satan?'' \n \n `` Well I'm not Stan,'' the voice joked. It did n't seem like the voice shared a room with her. At the same time, Wendy felt the presence. She reached out to touch it but heard a tutting noise. \n \n `` Now, now. None of that. You stay over there and tell me what you want.'' \n \n `` I want to get revenge on them,'' Wendy said. `` All the people who make fun of me. All the people who say I'm a drama queen. All the girls who do n't invite me to their parties. I want them to suffer.'' \n \n `` Why do n't you just grow up and have a happy life and screw them over that way? Living well is the best revenge and all that,'' the voice spoke near her ear and simultaneously from a distant land. \n \n `` Because I need them to pay *now*. I need them to go through the hell they've put me through.'' \n \n `` I see,'' said the voice. `` So tell me exactly what you want to do.'' \n \n `` I want to cut out their eyes and punch them in the stomach and watch them bleed out and drop them in a tub of acid, and then I want to --'' \n \n `` Alright, so a lot of anger here,'' the voice said. `` Anger is good in moderation. All emotions are.'' \n \n `` You do n't *understand*!'' Wendy cried. `` I *need* them to suffer. I need them to pay! No one understands me. No one even *tries* to understand me. They all say I'm a child and that I'm making mountains out of molehills and they want to put me in therapy. They want to send me away to some freak school just because I'm *different*. No one understands me!'' \n \n `` Wow, did n't need your life story,'' the voice replied. Another small wind whipped past Wendy, and then she felt something clutched in her hand. \n \n `` Here. This is a sword. It will do great and powerful and terrible things for you. With every life it takes it grows stronger. But beware. With every life it takes it will also take more of a hold over you.'' \n \n `` As long as I can use it to get revenge.'' \n \n `` If that's what you wish,'' said the voice. \n \n `` So I do n't need to give you my soul or anything?'' \n \n `` Your payment will come in due time,'' the voice said. \n \n `` But how will I pay you?'' \n \n `` Just follow the shadows.'' There was another wooshing sound of wind, and then the lights of the bathroom flickered on of their own accord. \n \n In Wendy's hand was a long, thin blade that glimmered in the light. She tried it, flexing and relaxing her hand and smiling. *Finally. * \n \n Now she could make them understand. \n \n -- - \n \n Wendy still remembered the first kill. She remembered them all, but the first had been something all its own. The sword, she'd discovered, was not actually sharp. Running it through her younger brother he had lost his breath, stepping backwards and falling with the air lost from his lungs. He'd stared up at her and her sword with horror. \n \n `` This is for making fun of my clothing John,'' she said as she stabbed him again. The tip barely pierced his skin. He struggled and pushed back against her, rolling onto his side and kicking her legs out. She pinned him down, for once glad that she was the eldest and bigger in size. She hit him across the face and he turned his side, spitting out a mixture of blood and saliva. She hit him again. \n \n `` This is what you get for making fun of me,'' she stabbed him. `` This is what you get for laughing at my hair. This is what you get for calling me a nutter.'' \n \n It had taken him such a very long time to die. \n \n Then it became easier. With each kill the sword became more powerful and Wendy became more adept. She *wanted* to kill. She killed her school friends. She killed her teachers. Soon she was killing everyone that had ever made fun of her. The more she used the sword, the lighter it felt in her hand. The more she *wanted* to do it. \n \n Sometimes at night she would put the sword on her chest of drawers and look at it. It was magic somehow - or maybe cursed. No policeman had ever come near her. No trouble had ever followed her. But she was n't getting the feeling of relief she needed. If anything after each kill there was a hollowness that settled in her chest. But she found she could n't stop. She would go to sleep and wake up covered in someone's blood. \n \n Finally the day came when she lost control. In a fit of screaming rage she charged toward her younger brother and ran him through. The sword cut his flesh like butter and he stared at her with wide and open eyes. When the deed was done she screamed, propping him up and holding his head and screaming. \n \n She ran back into the bathroom with the sword in her hand and flung it into the bathtub. She sank to her knees, hugging them to her chest and sobbing. *He was only four. He was only four. * \n \n `` Satan,'' she screamed. She banged her fists upon the walls. `` Satan. *Satan*! Come back! Take your sword! I do n't want it. I do n't want it. Take it back.'' \n \n There was a wooshing of wind and the lights went out. The only sound was Wendy crying, still curled upon the floor. \n \n `` I did warn you,'' the voice scolded. \n \n `` Please. I take it all back. I take it all back. Please.'' \n \n `` You ca n't undo what you've done,'' the voice said. Once again it was in two places, close to her and far. `` But I can take you to a place where you will see your brothers again. And all three of you will live together forever. You can be happy.'' \n \n `` Please,'' she sobbed. `` Please. Take me there. I'll do anything.'' \n \n `` Think hard. You can never leave.'' \n \n Wendy shook her head. `` Take me. I'll go. I'll go anywhere you want. Satan, please. Just give me back my brothers.'' \n \n The voice was close now, almost whispering in her ear. `` I'll take you to them. But I'm not Satan, Wendy.'' \n \n She sniffed and rubbed her eyes. `` Who are you?'' \n \n `` My name is Peter.'' \n\n","LLM_1":"WENDY was researching dark magic on a hidden website, desperate to find a solution to deal with people making her life miserable. \n\nShe tried a recipe that involved summoning the Devil with vodka and jellybeans, leaving a stagnant concoction under the bed for weeks. After preparing the ritual, her heart pounding, \"SATAN, COME FORTH!\" she shouted, then realized her mistake.\n\nA breeze swept through, picking up toiletry items, before a mysterious presence appeared in front of Wendy. A voice jokingly said, 'Well I\u2019m not STAN,' and told her that all she wanted was revenge. However, he suggested she 'just grow' up.\n\nWENdy shared her anger and frustration, wanting those who mocked her dead. Peter, who was revealed as not the DEVIL, gave her a magical sword to satisfy her desire for revenge but warned her it would take control over her.\n\nWith the power of this sword came a growing desire to murder everyone who made her feel bad. As she continued to use the magical blade to take lives, it grew stronger, making it easier for her each time.\n\nBut one night, as Wendy charged towards her four-year-old brother with a scream, losing control, reality hit her hard, realizing what she did. Desperate, crying out for Satan to return and take the blade away, Peter's voice came, warning her she couldn't turn back.\n\nHowever, in exchange for taking her brothers back, He offered to reunite Wendy with them, promising her they would all live happily ever after. Yet, this 'deal' came with an unbreakable condition. Since Wendy agreed to this offer, with no option to leave, She was led to believe that Peter was Satan.\n\nIn the end, WENDy realized that her journey with this magical 'Sword' and its promise of revenge has been leading her down a path of darkness and self-destruction. Her brothers were never taken back but she remained trapped in this world where she agreed that this was her reality. WENdY remained in that darkness, trapped.","LLM_2":"Wendy delved into the dark world of magic, scouring a forbidden website in desperation for a way to silence the tormentors who had made life unbearable. She had tried everything, from the bizarre to absurd, but nothing seemed to work.\n\nHer latest experiment involved a ritual that required vodka, jelly beans, a dash of desperation,  and a pinch of madness. Under the guise of summonming the devil, she had concocted a potion and left it under her bed to brew for what felt like an eternity. With her pulse racing, Wendy stood tall, shouting \"Satan, arise!\" \u2013 but the only response was the howling wind.\n\nAs she gazed around her room, bewildered, an unexpected breeze picked up her toiletries, sending them swirling through the air. Before her very eyes, something began to materialize \u2013 a presence that seemed both familiar and yet utterly alien. The air vibrated with anticipation as a voice, dripping with sarcasm, chimed in, \"'Well, I'm not Stan,' he quipped, his tone tinged with amusement. 'You want revenge, don't you?' The mysterious figure \u2013 who wasn't, or so he claimed, Satan himself \u2013 seemed wise beyond his years.\n\nDespite his words of caution, wendY (with her name now scribbled in bold, almost mocking, letters) poured out her anguish and resentment, pleading for the satisfaction of seeing her tormenters meet their demise. It was then that she received a gift \u2013 or perhaps a curse \u2013 in the form of a mystical sword. Its blade gleamed with promise, its power so intoxicating that wEndy couldn\u2019t resist its call. But as she wielded it, taking lives with ease, came an unsettling realization: with each new victim, their blade grew more potent, feeding on her own rage.\n\nOne fateful night as wEND Y (her name etched in blood, now) lunged at her innocent four year old brother, all sense of control dissipated. Reality slammed into her, like a door closing on an eerie nightmare. \"Help me, help me,\" she screamed, calling out to Satan for deliverance from her blade's curse. And yet, just as the darkness seemed absolute, another voice intervened, cautioning her against the point of no return.\n\nYet, there was an offer \u2013 an exchange of sorts. If wEnDy (now almost lost in her delusions) agreed, they could reunify her with her brother \u2013 with the promise that they'd live a life filled with joy. Alas, that 'decent' deal came at a terrible price: an irreversible condition that led her to assume Peter (or Stan) was indeed the adversary she'd been searching for.\n\nUltimately, WendY's journey down the path, lured by the siren song of vengeance, had led only to darkness \u2013 and an awareness of her self-destructive tendencies. Though her family remained lost to her forever, one inescapable truth had sunk in \u2013 she was trapped, forever bound to a world that was both her creation and her prison.","op1":"summary","op2":"polish","domain":"writingprompts","model":"llama"}

While the idea of evaluating structural components via Shapley value is promising for automated robot design, the paper's novelty is limited beyond this concept. The experimental evaluation is weak, relying solely on a multi-agent sumo environment that complicates analysis due to environmental non-stationarity. Testing in simpler, single-agent settings would better isolate algorithm performance. The method lacks clarity in key areas: the objective function is not clearly formulated, policy inheritance between agents with differing topologies is unexplained, and the choice of SVG for controller training is unjustified given more stable alternatives. A background on Shapley value with mathematical formulation is needed, along with an ablation study to validate its impact. There are concerns that Shapley value may exacerbate local minima issues\u2014critical in morphology evolution\u2014by discouraging coordinated changes (e.g., adding symmetrical limbs). The current experiments focus only on ant-like agents and do not demonstrate meaningful topological diversity. Presentation and writing quality require improvement. Additional experiments and clearer exposition are necessary to strengthen the paper\u2019s contribution.","LLM_2":"**Review Comment (Rewritten):**\n\nThis work investigates the co-evolution of agent morphologies and controllers using the PEOM algorithm, which incorporates Shapley values to estimate the contribution of individual body parts and guide evolutionary search. The use of Shapley values to inform structural optimization is conceptually interesting and holds potential for advancing automated robot design. However, the overall novelty of the approach appears limited beyond this core idea.\n\nThe experimental evaluation is a significant weakness. The sole use of a multi-agent sumo environment introduces non-stationarity due to concurrent policy updates, making it difficult to disentangle the algorithm\u2019s effectiveness from environmental dynamics. Evaluation in simpler, single-agent locomotion tasks would provide clearer insights into the method\u2019s performance and enable more controlled analysis.\n\nSeveral aspects of the method lack sufficient clarity. The objective function is not formally defined, hindering reproducibility. The mechanism for policy inheritance across agents with differing morphologies is inadequately explained, as is the rationale for using SVG (Stochastic Variance Gradient) for controller optimization\u2014particularly given the existence of more robust and widely-used alternatives. A concise theoretical background on Shapley values, including their mathematical formulation in this context, should be provided to improve accessibility.\n\nFurthermore, an ablation study demonstrating the actual impact of Shapley-based component evaluation is missing. This is critical: without such evidence, it is unclear how much the Shapley computation contributes to performance gains. There is also a plausible concern that Shapley values could impede exploration of coordinated morphological changes\u2014such as symmetric limb additions\u2014by attributing low marginal value to individual components, thereby reinforcing local optima. This risk is especially pertinent in morphology evolution, where global structural innovations are essential.\n\nThe current experiments focus exclusively on ant-like agents and do not exhibit substantial topological diversity, limiting the generality of the findings. Broader morphological exploration would strengthen the paper\u2019s claims.\n\nFinally, the presentation and writing quality require revision for clarity, precision, and flow. Additional experiments, improved exposition, and a more rigorous empirical analysis are necessary to substantiate the proposed method and elevate the paper\u2019s contribution.","op1":"summary","op2":"rewrite","domain":"openreview","model":"Qwen"}
{"human":"       Hi Everyone,  (do I have everyone on my e-list above?)          First of all, I still (okay, I'm a complete idiot) can't figure out how to post on the group's blog. Although I have a 'profile,' the name of our blog doesn't come up so I can't get into it in posting mode. I can, of course, read the blog. If anyone can give me a hint as to how to do this correctly, I'd be grateful.          Second and much more important, we had a very good meeting last night, I thought. I hope all the contributors got something useful from the discussion of their works.           At the end, we talked about how it went and what we'd like to do to make it even better in the future.  Here are the suggestions that came from that discussion.           --Each time we meet, anyone who CAN'T attend should let others know so that we don't wait for someone who is not coming. Email, blog post, telephone--just let the group or someone who is coming know that you can't make it.          --We will start on time, so if the meeting is scheduled for 6 p.m., that's when the writing exercise person will get us going. If you want to socialize before the meeting, come early!  If we need to change the meeting time to accommodate people who have to come from across town or whatever, we can do that.           --At least for next time, the group that is presenting their works should get them to the rest of us by email NO LATER THAN A WEEK BEFORE THE MEETING. If we want to go back to the other method, that is, you distribute your work at the meeting before the meeting where you present, we can do that. But only Tony brought her work to distribute last night, so we decided to distribute works by email for next time.          --Everyone should read everything two or three times before the discussion. That's why we need to get the works distributed early.           --Also, let's give our marked copies to the author after the discussion--that way she or he can contemplate suggestions, queries, etc. that aren't necessarily covered in the discussion.           --If you come to the meeting, please make every effort to stay the whole time. That's the level of commitment that will make the group work. We will do everything possible to stay on t ack, so that we begin and end on time.  Again, we can change the time to accommodate people if need be.          --These suggestions come from me. Could everyone put their name, the date of the discussion, and page numbers on their works? This will enable all of us to be better organized.           --Another suggestion from me--we can talk about this one. Perhaps the person assigned to lead us in a writing exercise each time could also be the 'leader' for that night--keeping us on track with the time, serving as a contact person for last minute drop-outs, etc.  I fell naturally into the leader's role last night, and while I could continue to do that, I think it would feel more like a writing GROUP if we shared that responsibility.  Let's discuss this, and indeed, we can discuss all of these comments.            --Future meetings.  Our next meeting will be Monday, August 23, 6-8 p.m. unless we decided differently over email. For September, we pencilled in  the 13th and the 27th (so as to avoid meeting on Labor Day weekend).   Following that schedule, the October meetings would be on  the 11th nd the 25th, which works well with my travel schedule. Again, all of this can be discussed and changed, but we wanted to at least begin to look ahead.           Thanks to everyone who worked hard to make last night's meeting a sucess.  Special thanks to our four illustrious contributors\/guinea pigs who held up beautifully under the group's scrutiny.

She praised the recent meeting, highlighting suggestions for improvement: members should notify the group if they can\u2019t attend; meetings will start promptly at 6 p.m., with socializing encouraged beforehand; works should be shared via email at least a week before the meeting; everyone should read submissions multiple times; marked copies should be given to authors after discussion for further reflection; attendees should commit to staying the entire session; contributors should include their name, date, and page numbers on their work; and the writing exercise leader could also serve as the meeting facilitator to share leadership. The next meeting is scheduled for August 23 from 6\u20138 p.m., with September dates tentatively set for the 13th and 27th, and October meetings on the 11th and 25th.

If anyone has tips or can lend a hand, she\u2019d greatly appreciate the support!\n\nThat said, she had nothing but praise for our most recent meeting. The energy was lively, the feedback thoughtful, and the conversation deeply engaging. Inspired by the positive momentum, she shared several suggestions to help us run even more smoothly moving forward:\n\n- **Attendance & Punctuality:** Let\u2019s aim to start right at 6 p.m. sharp. If you\u2019re unable to make it, a quick heads-up to the group would be helpful.  \n- **Pre-Meeting Hangouts:** Feel free to arrive early! The hour before is a great time for casual chat and connection.  \n- **Submission Guidelines:** To give everyone enough time to read and reflect, please send your work via email at least one week in advance.  \n- **Reading Commitment:** We encourage reading each piece multiple times\u2014it helps deepen your feedback and appreciation.  \n- **Feedback in Hand:** After discussion, marked copies should be returned to the author for their personal review and reflection.  \n- **Full Engagement:** If you\u2019re attending, plan to stay through the full two-hour session. Your presence matters!  \n- **Formatting Tips:** When sharing your work, don\u2019t forget to include your name, the date, and page numbers\u2014small touches that make a big difference.  \n- **Shared Leadership:** The writing exercise leader could also take on the role of meeting facilitator. It\u2019s a simple way to rotate responsibility and keep things fresh.\n\nLooking ahead:  \nOur next official meetup is set for **August 23rd, 6\u20138 p.m.**  \nSeptember looks to be tentatively scheduled for the **13th and 27th**, with October meetings penciled in for the **11th and 25th**.  \n\nOf course, all of this is open for input\u2014nothing is set in stone. We value collaboration, and every voice counts.\n\nFinally, a heartfelt thank-you from Christine to everyone who participated, especially the four brave souls who shared their work. The quality of discussion reminded us all why we\u2019re here: to grow, connect, and write boldly together.\n\nLet\u2019s keep the momentum going!","op1":"summary","op2":"rewrite","domain":"blog","model":"Qwen"}

{"human":"It has remained controversial whether and in what way suppression of the pituitary-gonadal axis using GnRH analogues can reduce the destructive effects of chemotherapy on ovarian primordial follicles and thus prevent ovarian failure. GnRH antagonists suppress gonadotrophin levels immediately after administration. In this study we determined whether administration of the GnRH antagonist cetrorelix before exposure to increasing doses of cyclophosphamide (Cy) affected the number of surviving primordial follicles (PMF) in the mice ovary.Highly inbred young Balb\/c mice (114 females) were injected with 0, 50 and 75 mg\/kg of Cy. In each treatment group, half of the females were injected daily with cetrorelix starting 9 days before and 7 days post-administration of Cy. In serial sequential ovarian sections the total number of PMF in both ovaries was counted.Ovaries exposed to Cy at doses of 50 and 75 mg\/kg had significantly fewer PMF than those in the control group (P < 0.01). In each of the Cy groups used, pretreatment with cetrorelix resulted in significantly higher numbers of PMF: in the 50 mg\/kg Cy group only 14% were destroyed (cetrorelix group) versus 53% (P < 0.001), while in the 75 mg\/kg Cy group only 35% of PMF were destroyed versus 54% in animals treated only with Cy (P < 0.004).

Normalization of pCO\u2082 after hypocapnia resulted in hyperemia in the striatum. These effects were not substantially altered by hyperglycemia or ketosis. Declines in ADC (suggesting brain cell swelling) during hypocapnia, however, were greater during both hyperglycemia and ketosis.","LLM_1":"Severely low carbon dioxide levels (hypocapnea) can reduce blood circulation to brain and increase the risk of brain swelling and injury, particularly in diabetic children, but the impact of this condition alone is not expected. Researchers investigated whether high blood sugar or excessive ketones could alter this effect. They induced low CO2 levels in juvenile rat groups with and without these conditions and measured blood and brain changes. Results showed that blood supply to brains decreased in response to low oxygen, and this decrease was more pronounced with high sugar and excessive acids, indicating greater brain damage risk. After the condition was corrected, some areas experienced increased blood activity. Overall, high glucose and acids did not significantly affect the brain's response. However, brain cells showed more swelling in conditions with these factors. This research provides insights into how low blood oxygen affects the brains of diabetic patients, especially children who are prone to severe brain complications.","LLM_2":"Severe hypocapnia, characterized by abnormally low levels of carbon-dioxide, can compromise cerebral blood flow and elevate the susceptibility to cerebral edema and trauma, notably in pediatric diabetic populations. Notwithstanding the isolated effects of hypocapaenia, researchers sought to elucidate the potential modulatory roles of hyperglycemia and ketosis on this phenomenon. To this end, juvenile rats with or without hyperglucemia\/ketosis were subjected to hypocapanic conditions, with subsequent assessments of blood-brain dynamics. The results indicated a diminution in cerebral perfusion in the face of low pO2, a decrement that was exacerbated by concomitant hypergylcemic and acidic conditions. Conversely, following correction of these aberrant conditions in some brain regions, an upregulation of cerebral activity was observed. Although hyperglecimia and acidosis failed to significantly impact the cerebral response, these pathological states were associated with augmented cerebral swelling.

{"human":"This paper presents \"EnsembleNet\" a multihead neural network architecture where the multiple heads have the same architecture and are all (roughly) trying to predict the same thing.  The diversity of this \"ensemble\" comes from the random weight initialization.  The paper investigates and compares the ensemble loss structure and the co-distillation loss structure.  They make the interesting observation that for the ensembling loss structure, performance is better when one puts a negative weight on the loss of the ensemble (the mean of the multiple heads) while putting larger weights on the performance of the individual head losses. They also show that for the case of square loss, if the ensembling model is a simple average, then the ensembling loss and the co-distillation loss are equivalent. Finally, they present a general strategy for converting a network to an EnsembleNet.\n\nThey hyperparameter tune with both losses and find that the co-distillation loss is marginally better than the ensemble loss structure.  Overall gains over baseline seem moderate.  \n\nI don't think this paper is an accept.  It has a couple interesting insights, but they seem rather subtle... perhaps this would be of interest to people who are specifically researching these types of ensembles.","LLM_1":"The paper introduces EnsembleNet, a multihead neural network where identically structured heads predict the same target, with diversity from random initialization. It compares ensemble and co-distillation loss structures, noting that ensemble performance improves with a negative weight on the ensemble loss and higher weights on individual heads.
