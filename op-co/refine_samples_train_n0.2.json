{"human":"As reflected in its name, Kolmogorov Growth takes inspiration from Kolmogorov complexity and the growth function. Conceptually, KG measures the size of the simplest class of functions that a given function f belongs to.

KG by itself is obviously not computable, but the paper proposes an interesting way to approximate it.\n\nThe generalization bound in section 3.1 is not particularly surprising. In a sense, the proof for this bound is embedded in the definition of KG itself. Still, I think this is an interesting approach to bounding the generalization error.\n\nNetwork-to-network regularization is motivated by the results in section 3.1, which show that functions that can be approximated well by small networks will have low KG. N2N trains a small student network and a large teacher network to output similar predictions to each other. This makes the student learn from the teacher, while the teacher is regularized by the simpler function of the student. The paper also considers a multi-level version where a sequence of progressively smaller networks are trained with the same loss.\n\nN2N hinges on the implicit assumption that smaller networks have smaller hypothesis spaces and thus learn simpler functions. While this is likely true in a strict sense, many results with neural networks show that small networks have surprisingly strong expressive power. For example, works on knowledge distillation show that minimal networks can achieve accuracy close to that of a large teacher, and [1] shows that a rather small network can fit random labels. I think this implicit assumption and its limitations should be discussed a bit more in the paper.\n\nExperiments show that N2N acts as an effective regularizer and that N2N regularization indeed reduces the KG bound. It would have been interesting to additionally include the generalization gap in Figure 2 so that the KG bound can be compared with it.\n\nThere may be a more direct correspondence between Kolmogorov complexity and KG. In KG\u2019s definition (section 3), you essentially construct a short two-part program for describing the function f where you first describe the function class F and then specify f within F.

These were often run by women known as \"alewives,\" who would signal that fresh brew was available by suspending a bush\u2014commonly referred to as a \"bushel\" or simply a \"bush\"\u2014on a pole outside the dwelling, giving rise to the phrase \"good ale is under the bush.\"\n\nOver time, alehouses evolved into central social institutions within local communities, serving not only as places for drinking but also for exchanging news, conducting informal business, and organizing mutual aid. This communal function laid the groundwork for the development of the modern public house, commonly known as the \"pub.\" The rapid spread of alehouses prompted regulatory responses; by 965, King Edgar of England issued decrees restricting villages to a single licensed alehouse, reflecting early efforts to control both the quantity and conduct associated with such establishments.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you'd like citations added (e.g., in Wikipedia citation style) or if this article has a specific section or title you'd like maintained.","op1":"refine","op2":"polish","domain":"squad","model":"Qwen"}
{"human":"`` There's been a murder. I do n't believe it. Someone reported a murder.'' \n \n `` A murder?'' I asked. \n \n `` You know, a premeditated killing. Deliberately ending the life of your fellow man. The thing in the back of your training manual that you only read once because you were never going to need it.'' My partner explained. \n \n `` That's... You...'' I felt sick just thinking about it. *'' How? `` * \n \n Between the brain tweaks and good old-fashioned cultural conditioning, most people could barely *consider* the idea of attacking a fellow citizen.

We find out who did it, and we arrest them.'' \n \n We climbed into the car and rode in silence. I tried to imagine what sort of mind could do such a thing. What sort of person would be able to cut a throat or crush a skull without being crushed by guilt? Was he consumed by some emotion that it overcame his conditioning? Some glitch in his brain that turned off his sense of reason? Could his mind even still function, knowing what he'd done? \n \n `` Do you think,'' I asked nervously, `` He'd be able to, um... resist arrest?'' The phrase was almost foreign to me, it showed up in legal textbooks and nowhere else. Nobody resisted the police. Once we found the criminal, our work was done. \n \n `` He might.'' My partner said grimly. `` When we find this guy, we'll ask him politely, but we might have to use force.'' \n \n He shook his head. `` I never thought I'd actually need that training in this day and age.'' \n \n `` Training?'' \n \n `` When I was in the academy, I was a big history buff, so I read about an old martial art called'Arrest and Control Techniques.' About five hundred years ago, they invented it to restrain people by force without killing them. Would you believe, that was actually considered good police work back then?'' \n \n `` Really?'' \n \n `` Yeah. Because at least you were n't shooting them, right? Life was brutal in the early 2000s. Anyway, long story short, the academy still has the old holo-training manuals for use of violence, so I watched one. Nasty stuff.'' \n \n I grimaced. I was n't into that sort of thing. I had joined the force because I wanted to solve mysteries, not because I had sick fantasies about beating people up. \n \n We pulled up at the crime scene, a tall hab-block. An ambulance was already there, and I saw a woman sitting on a bench, a soma patch pressed on her arm to calm her down. She must have been the one to find the body, poor girl. \n \n We walked upstairs and into the apartment, following her directions. Bile rose in my throat as I stared at the body, and even my more hardened partner turned pale. \n \n The victim was covered in long, bloody gashes, and the hardwood floor was covered in dark-brown spatters where it had dried. Lurid patterns of blood surrounded him, gruesome smears and sprays as if someone had tried to fingerpaint in blood. So much blood. Who could have... \n \n `` Hey, rookie, you still with me?'' \n \n I nodded. `` Just... Getting my bearings.'' \n \n `` In all my years on force, I have n't seen anything like this.'' \n \n `` You do n't seem affected.'' \n \n He sighed heavily. `` I do n't know why that is. Not everyone's wired the same way, I suppose.'' \n \n `` Do you think that's what this was? Someone who's just... wired the wrong way? Can someone really be born this messed up?'' \n \n `` Not for the past century, as far as I know.'' \n \n `` Then we've got two mysteries to solve.'' I reached up and flipped on my visor, and the bloody corpse was covered by the soft blue glow of my forensic scanner. `` I'll scan the scene, can you check the hab's cameras?'' \n \n `` You sure you do n't want to do that the other way around? You do n't have to make yourself look tough in front of me.'' \n \n I shook my head. `` No. I need to handle this. I'm not going to be dead weight on this case.'' \n \n `` Suit yourself.'' He turned away from the body and pulled out his tablet. \n \n I turned my attention back to the body. I had a feeling this would n't be the only horror I'd see on this case.\n","LLM_1":"There\u2019s been a murder. I don\u2019t believe it.

{"human":"Epilepsy is a serious brain disorder characterized by recurrent unprovoked seizures. Approximately two-thirds of seizures can be controlled with antiepileptic medications (Kwan 2000). For some of the others, surgery can completely eliminate or significantly reduce the occurrence of disabling seizures. Localization of epileptogenic areas for resective surgery is far from perfect, and new tools are being investigated to more accurately localize the epileptogenic zone (the zone of the brain where the seizures begin) and improve the likelihood of freedom from postsurgical seizures. Recordings of pathological high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) may be one such tool.To assess the ability of HFOs to improve the outcomes of epilepsy surgery by helping to identify more accurately the epileptogenic areas of the brain.We searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialized Register (15 April 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library (2013, Issue 3), MEDLINE (Ovid) (1946 to 15 April 2013), CINAHL (EBSCOhost) (15 April 2013), Web of Knowledge (Thomson Reuters) (15 April 2013), www.clinicaltrials.gov (15 April 2013), and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (15 April 2013).We included studies that provided information on the outcomes of epilepsy surgery at at least six months and which used high-frequency oscillations in making decisions about epilepsy surgery.The primary outcome of the review was the Engel Class Outcome System.

The combination of these two studies resulted in 11 participants who prospectively used ictal HFOs for epilepsy surgery decision making. Results of the postsurgical seizure freedom Engel class I to IV outcome were determined over a period of 12 to 38 months (average 23.4 months) and indicated that six participants had an Engel class I outcome (seizure freedom), two had class II (rare disabling seizures), three had class III (worthwhile improvement).

{"human":"   In one of the rooms of a seemingly-ordinary unit in a housing block, a fifteen-year-old girl lay sleeping. Everything about this girl seemed normal, from her long dark hair down to the tips of her toes. Yet a look around her room clearly showed that she was not what you and I would call \u201cordinary\u201d. Various books lay scattered on the floor with names such as  Intermediate Transfiguration  and  Charms for the Charmed \u2013 An Intermediate Course . On a study table nearby lay several quills, ink bottles, pieces of yellowing parchment, and most mysteriously \u2013 a wand. The posters on the walls were of boybands and handsome singers \u2013 but unlike normal posters, the people in those posters were moving, flashing their plastic smiles or mouthing lyrics. The clothes spread out on the chair were not your normal T-shirt and jeans, but long, deep-blue robes.  Cheryl Cheah was a witch.  Even as a solitary ray of light fell on her sleeping form, there was a loud knock on the door, and muffled shouts of \u201cWake up, sleepyhead!\u201d   The girl stirred, and with a yawn, sat up on her bed. Putting on her glasses, she looked up at the clock on the wall. It was 9.30 a.m.   Throwing a disgusted look at the door (the shouts were becoming louder, progressing to not-so-subtle insults like \u201cWake up, you pig!\u201d) she shouted, \u201cComing!\u201d and got out of bed. She wished she could have slept longer. After all, she had slept at 2 a.m. that morning, having stayed up to celebrate the New Year.  After getting dressed and taking a shower, she made her way to the kitchen, finding her family seated round the kitchen table, eagerly awaiting breakfast. \u201c\u2019Morning, sleepyhead,\u201d a man at the head of the table said, smiling.  Cheryl grinned back at her father, and sat down at the table. Soon enough she was eating her way through her bacon and eggs with gusto.   \u201cYou better hurry and get your stuff packed, we\u2019re leaving at 10.30 to get your books,\u201d her mother said, pointing her wand to the plates in the sink. The tap immediately turned on by itself and a sponge started scrubbing the plates. \u201cAnd, by the way, it\u2019s already 10.15,\u201d Mrs. Cheah said with a small smile.  Cheryl choked. Swallowing down the last of her egg, she rushed to her room. She eyed the mess her room was in with horror. Apparently she had not bothered to clear up in the two months of her holiday. Well, she had to pay for her laziness now. Hastily, she threw her robes into a trunk and her books and writing materials into a sling bag. Then snatching her wand from the table, she quickly surveyed the room once again to see if she had left anything behind, before dragging both trunk and sling bag into the hall.   \u201cWell, that was quick,\u201d her father said dryly. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s go.\u201d   They made their way downstairs and into a car, trying to be as inconspicuous as possible, though how to be inconspicuous with a large trunk and a piece of wood sticking out of your jeans\u2019 back pocket I don\u2019t know. Soon they were off, heading out of the suburban haven of Tampines towards town.  The journey was rather quick \u2013 Cheryl had barely settled down before they screeched to a halt in front of a tall, imposing building. A sign over the nearest entrance read \u201cChange Alley\u201d. Quickly, they made their way through the entrance and down a rather deserted corridor, stopping in front of an ice cream stall. There was only one person there \u2013 a young man of about 20, who was manning the stall.   \u201c\u2019Morning, Basil,\u201d Mr. Cheah said briskly. The man named Basil grinned back and waved to Cheryl and her sister Cherie, who were both looking longingly at the many tubs of ice cream on display.  \u201cCome on, let\u2019s go before a Muggle sees,\u201d Mrs. Cheah whispered, as the family made their way to the front of a large glass pane at the back of the stall. \u201cCheryl, you go first.\u201d  Cheryl took a deep breath before walking straight through the barrier. It felt as if cool water was cascading down from the ceiling. Yet when she emerged from the other side, she was still perfectly dry. A few moments later she was joined by her family once again.  \u201cWelcome to Change Alley,\u201d a voice said.

Her long dark hair spilled over the pillow like ink on silk, and her glasses rested neatly beside her on the nightstand. But beyond the surface normalcy, the room whispered secrets.\n\nBooks with titles like *Intermediate Transfiguration* and *Charms for the Charmed* were scattered across the floor. A study table overflowed with quills, jars of ink, yellowing parchment, and a slender wand lying casually between open notebooks. Posters of boybands covered the walls\u2014but these idols didn\u2019t just stand still. They winked, smiled, spun in slow pirouettes, their silent songs looping endlessly in enchanted frames.

{"human":"Metarhizium anisopliae is an entomopathogenic fungus used in the biological control of some agricultural insect pests, and efforts are underway to use this fungus in the control of insect-borne human diseases. A large repertoire of proteins must be secreted by M. anisopliae to cope with the various available nutrients as this fungus switches through different lifestyles, i.e., from a saprophytic, to an infectious, to a plant endophytic stage. To further evaluate the predicted secretome of M. anisopliae, we employed genomic and transcriptomic analyses, coupled with phylogenomic analysis, focusing on the identification and characterization of secreted proteins.We determined the M. anisopliae E6 genome sequence and compared this sequence to other entomopathogenic fungi genomes. A robust pipeline was generated to evaluate the predicted secretomes of M. anisopliae and 15 other filamentous fungi, leading to the identification of a core of secreted proteins. Transcriptomic analysis using the tick Rhipicephalus microplus cuticle as an infection model during two periods of infection (48 and 144 h) allowed the identification of several differentially expressed genes. This analysis concluded that a large proportion of the predicted secretome coding genes contained altered transcript levels in the conditions analyzed in this study. In addition, some specific secreted proteins from Metarhizium have an evolutionary history similar to orthologs found in Beauveria\/Cordyceps. This similarity suggests that a set of secreted proteins has evolved to participate in entomopathogenicity.","LLM_1":"*Metarhizium anisopliae* is an entomopathogenic fungus applied in biological pest control and explored for managing insect-borne human diseases.

{"human":"So you humans just drew imaginary lines on your planet and fought real wars defending them? \n \n Yes but you have to understand our world is all we knew, we we're stuck... in a way. \n \n I understand, your species were still developing a means of star and dimensional travel. According to our understanding you were exactly one thousand two hundred and thirty seven years from completing or, `` discovering'' as you would say, the materials and configuration of your vessel to achieve this. \n \n I.. I did n't think it would have taken us that long. \n \n Normally it does not, the `` wars'' you described have slowed down your development and completion of knowledge considerably. As well as isolating your creators, which in turn effected their ability to share and communicate with one another. \n \n Creators? \n \n Yes you have beings, most of you in fact, that have the ability to create and connect with a creative force which allows them to plan and bring new objects and ideas into the world. \n \n Ahh your talking about `` creative people'', yeah we have lots of those. I'm one in fact!, although my wife probably would n't agree haha. They can have many different jobs in our world, artists, scientists, writers, designers and things like that. \n \n Yes, yes we understand how you humans delegate roles for imaginary value, what we really want to understand is why you would isolate and kill each other at the detriment of yourselves and development? \n \n Well that imaginary value that your were talking about is what we call money. Different imaginary lands we have on earth, countries, have collected different amounts of money so... Sometimes we want more, or dont have enough, or just want to be bigger than other countries so we can lead the world. \n \n But the good earth is rich and can provide for everyone. As one of your creators once said. \n \n Charlie Chaplin said that in The Great Dictator did n't he? ahah \n \n He is a creator is he not? \n \n Well I guess, but he was more of a..nevermind. People also fight about religion, what they believe, their imagination, that thing you seem to respect so much. They believe in some imaginary being in the sky, and then someone else believes in another imaginary being and then they fight over who's right or wrong. \n It's really stupid I have to admit. \n \n You are referring to God? \n \n Yeah what some people would call their `` God'' it's kind of embarrassing, I'm surprised you know what I'm talking about. Well that makes it much easier to explain then. I'm sure your advanced civilization has evolved past such stupid ideas long ago, that's why we're still so damn far behind you. Hopefully we'll smarten up soon and move on to things that actually exist. And use our brains and logic to advance ourselves, like you. \n \n No human, your logic and intelligence alone will not help you to advance. You are a product of your world, and so is your understanding. Your logic, human logic, will change and grow into something else entirely as you learn to explore. \n As for what you call `` God'' if I am correct is similar to our understanding of the eternal energy that exists in all beings and matter. It is very much real, and we communicate with it constantly. It is that very energy that has given us our existence and continues to guide us in our understanding. \n \n You've spoken to God? I think maybe you're misunderstanding what I mean by `` God''. Big man in the sky, big white beard? \n \n Like I said human, your race is a product of your world. Your idea of God is tied to your belief that you are the most important and only life within this universe. I'm sorry to say you are not, and `` God'' as you call it, did not stop creating after Earth came into being. \n The separation of faith in something you do not yet fully understand is where your folly lies. For those with the wisdom of belief, in your world, must come to an understanding. \n That whether they are right or wrong, their understanding of God does not matter. Your connection and kindness to one another does. \n That regardless to difference of belief, it is all the same point of creation. \n You have creators in your world and you must value them more than \n any imaginary paper, they will be the key to your species growth in understanding. \n \n I ca n't believe I finally get to speak with an alien being and he turns out to be a intergalactic door knocking fucking evangelist. Fuck off with that God shit, you want me to believe some invisible space being magically created everything. A guy who lets horrible shit happen in my world. I was wrong your species is n't advanced, you're a bunch of fucking morons. Where is he then, where the fuck is he, I have some fucking questions for that asshat! \n \n Your anger lies with your lack of understanding, your ideas of death and tragedy are masked with your small limited ability of thought and perception. There is a world beyond your pain and fear, but those emotions are in fact important mechanisms to your survival. Still there are worlds and places where these words and emotions have no meaning, a place where you and all your kind came into being. \n \n Yeah, that's fucking easy for you to say, do you know how fucking hard it is to exist with these thoughts and feelings? Show me then, show me with my own eyes and I'll believe you, you brainwashed idiot. \n \n You already know this, your species have learned this throughout all intellectual development. Your sight is limited even to other less intelligent species on your earth. You can only see so much, but you know and believe in so many ideas already. \n Ideas you can not and once could not, see without tools. Oxygen which allows you to live, gravity which keeps your feet on your earth, bacteria and the micro universe you are still `` discovering''. You want proof human? What do I look like to you? \n \n You look like a skinny grey... wait, no more like an animal now or a... light? I.. I do n't know. \n \n Our conversation will end here, we hope this knowledge will help your species to grow. Please share it with others in an effort to create peace. We will not speak to you again. Goodbye and Goodluck.\n","LLM_1":"So, humans, let's talk about your wars over imaginary borders. Yes. But your civilization is still stuck in development, just like we were. \n\nYou were about 1,237 years away from discovering the technology to travel through space and dimensions. Wars have held you back, isolated your innovators, limiting their capacity to collaborate and share knowledge. That's slowed your progress.\n\nYou have these beings that can tap into creative forces, creating and connecting with energy to bring ideas and objects into existence. Artists, innovaters, all types of creatives in human society. Isolating and killing each another over things you don't fully comprehend, is it really worth it? \n\nMoney is an imaginary construct. Countries collect it to gain more power and influence, sometimes even over eachother. Yet, Earth has more resources than it needs. One of yours once quoted that \"the good Earth is enough for all\". \n\nCharlie Chapin, an artist, expressed that idea in one his works. He's a part of human history and a reminder of what's truly valuable.\n\nFighting over beliefs and faith is another pitfall. Each side imagines their own version of an invisible being, then argues over which one is right. Some of these ideas are laughable, even embarrassing. Don't you think you've grown past this? Why are you still struggling with such basic concepts?\n\nYour understanding is shaped by your environment. Logic alone won't propel you forward. Explore, communicate, connect, grow, learn. What you consider 'God' is akin to a universal energy we connect to. This force gave you life and guides you.\n\nWe communicate constantly with this energy. Our world understands that we are part, not the whole. Separating faith from the unknown has led to folly. Connection and compassion to each one, regardless of differences, are key. Every point, every creation, shares a single source.\n\nValue your creaters more. Any imaginary boundaries, any limited understanding will only hinder your growth.\n\nMy anger is rooted in lack, pain, fear. Those emotions mask my limited perception and thought. Worlds beyond exist where they have meaning.\n\nBut, how hard is existing with pain? See for yourself, with eyes that see, beyond the limited. Bacteria, oxygen, tools to see beyond what was once unknown, these are all part your intellectual growth. Show you the proof you seek.\n\nWhat do we look to us? We are light. End of conversation.

The shackles of war, isolation, limited collaboration,  and knowledge sharing have indeed slowed down your evolution.\n\nYour kind possesses individuals who can channel the creative force, conjuring and bonding with the essence to manifest ideas, objects, art, innovation, \u2013 the entire spectrum of creativity. And yet, you allow your differences to isolate and destroy one another, over issues you barely comprehend. Tell me, isn't this a price too steep to pay?\n\nMoney, a concept born from imagination, fuels your pursuit of power, influence \u2013 even at each other's expense. Meanwhile, this planet teems with resources, far more than you need. As one of you once wisely said, 'the Earth's abundance is sufficient for everyone.'\n\nCharlie Chapman, that legendary artist and historian, embodied this notion in his work. His legacy reminds us of our shared values, what truly matters.\n\nWarring over faith and beliefs has also become an entrenched pit. Both sides conjure their versions of this invisible entity, only to debate which is the 'right' one. Many of us can't help but chuckle at these simplistic, childish notions. Haven't we outgrown such elementary concepts? Then, why do you continue to grapple with them?\n\nOur understanding, shaped as it is by our surroundings, cannot propel us forward on its own. We must explore, share, link, expand, study. Consider the universal force that animates all life, guiding us toward unity and wisdom. It is this same energy that you call 'god,' yet it transcends your narrow definitions.\n\nIn our world, we understand that every point \u2013 every being \u2013 shares the single, ultimate source. Fusing faith with mystery has, in the past, led us astray. Compassion, connection, understanding \u2013 regardless \u2013 are the keys to your true growth and development.\n\nEmbrace your creators more deeply. Shed any imaginary limits, for they only impede your advancement. I speak from a place of anger, rooted as I am in pain and fear, yet this too is a form of limited knowledge.\n\nThere are worlds beyond yours, where these emotions are but mere echoes. Witness the truth for what it truly is \u2013 pain exists, yes, but do not confuse it with existence.\n\nConsider the bacteria, air, instruments \u2013 all these tools are integral to expanding your understanding. Present the evidence you so desperately seek, rather than simply relying on limited perspectives.\n\nAs you are, I see that. In the end, our essence is light \u2013 a truth beyond your comprehension.

Recently, placenta-derived human mesenchymal stem cells (PMSCs) have shown similarities with bone marrow-derived MSCs in terms of regenerative capabilities and immunogenicity. This study investigates the hypothesis that treatment with PMSCs reduces the development of bronchiolitis obliterans in a murine heterotopic tracheal transplant model.A murine heterotopic tracheal transplant model was used to study the continuum from acute to chronic rejection. In the treatment groups, PMSCs or PMSC-conditioned medium (PMSCCM) were injected either locally or intratracheally into the allograft. Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or blank medium was injected in the control groups. Tracheal luminal obliteration was assessed on sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Infiltration of inflammatory and immune cells and epithelial progenitor cells was assessed using immunohistochemistry and densitometric analysis.Compared with injection of PBS, local injection of PMSCs significantly reduced luminal obliteration at 28 days after transplantation (P\u00a0=\u00a0.015). Intratracheal injection of PMSCs showed similar results to local injection of PMSCs compared with injection of PBS and blank medium (P\u00a0=\u00a0.022). Tracheas treated with PMSC\/PMSCCM showed protection against the loss of epithelium on day 14, with an increase in P63+CK14+ epithelial progenitor cells and Foxp3+ regulatory T cells. In addition, injection of PMSCs and PMSCCM significantly reduced the number of neutrophils and CD3+ T cells on day 14.","LLM_1":"Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) demonstrate therapeutic potential in acute lung injury.

Given the established regenerative and immunomodulatory properties of bone marrow-derived MSCs in acute lung injury, we hypothesized that PMSCs would similarly mitigate airway obliteration. Experimental cohorts received either local or intratracheal administration of PMSCs or PMSC-conditioned medium (PMSCCM), with control groups receiving phosphate-buffered saline or blank medium. Histopathological evaluation via hematoxylin and eosin staining at 28 days post-transplant demonstrated that both local and intratracheal PMSC delivery significantly reduced tracheal luminal obliteration compared to controls (P = 0.015 and P = 0.022, respectively). Immunohistochemical and densitometric analyses at day 14 revealed that PMSC\/PMSCCM treatment promoted epithelial preservation, marked by an expansion of P63+CK14+ epithelial progenitor cells and Foxp3+ regulatory T cells, concomitant with a reduction in neutrophil and CD3+ T-cell infiltration. These findings indicate that PMSCs ameliorate BO through mechanisms involving epithelial regeneration and immunomodulation, supporting their potential as a cell-based therapy for chronic airway rejection.","op1":"refine","op2":"rewrite","domain":"pubmedqa","model":"ds"}

Most were already in prison, accused of acting for Israel, it says.\nIn addition, \"perceived political opponents\" of Hamas were abducted, tortured or assaulted - \"particularly members of the rival Fatah party and former members of the Palestinian Authority security forces in Gaza\".\n\"These abuses too were committed with impunity,\" the report says.\nBBC Middle East correspondent Kevin Connelly says Hamas exercises undisputed authority within Gaza, and Amnesty's powerful report depicts an organisation responding to the relentless pressure of Israeli military operations with a brutal campaign against its own enemies within.\nIn one incident, six men were shot dead outside a mosque as they knelt in hoods in front of a crowd of men, women, and children, the report says.\nThe killings were among a series of \"spine-chilling actions, some of which amounted to war crimes, [and] were designed to exact revenge and spread fear across the Gaza Strip,\" Amnesty regional director Philip Luther said.\nAmnesty called on the Palestinian authorities to \"impartially and independently\" investigate the allegations, and bring the perpetrators to justice.","LLM_1":"Amnesty International reports that during last summer's 50-day Gaza war, Hamas forces carried out summary executions and abuses against Palestinians accused of collaborating with Israel, as well as against political opponents.

Clearance of pulmonary edema can be upregulated by stimulation of \u03b2-adrenergic receptors (\u03b2ARs). Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in \u03b2AR genes have functional effects in vitro and in vivo. We hypothesized that SNPs in \u03b2AR genes would be associated with rates of utilization of donor lung allografts offered for transplantation.Nine hundred fifty-one organ donors were genotyped for 4 amino-acid-coding SNPs in the \u03b2AR genes. Lung allograft utilization was compared among donors stratified by genotypes.Utilization of donor lung allografts was 55% vs 35% (p = 0.02) among donors with GG vs AA\/AG genotypes of the Ser49Gly SNP, 39% vs 32% (p = 0.04) with GG vs AA\/AG genotype of Gly16Arg SNP and 37% vs 32% (p = 0.1) with CC vs GC\/GG genotype of the Arg389Gly SNP.

This study investigated the association between four amino acid\u2013altering \u03b2AR single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and lung allograft acceptance in a cohort of 951 organ donors.

Then, SAP was induced in rats by the retrograde injection of 5% sodium taurocholate into the pancreatic duct. The control group received only a sham operation. Lung and pancreas samples were harvested after induction of SAP. The protein levels of HMGB1, matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) in lung tissue were investigated. The severity of pancreatic injury was determined by a histological score of pancreatic injury, serum amylase, and pancreatic water content. The lung injury was evaluated by measurement of pulmonary microvascular permeability, lung myeloperoxidase activity and malondialdehyde levels.The results found that in pRNA-U6.1\/Neo-HMGB1 treated rats, serum tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) levels were decreased and the severity of pancreatic tissue injury was less compared with either untreated SAP or pRNA-U6.1\/Neo-vector treated rats (P<0.05). The administration of pRNA-U6.1\/Neo-HMGB1 in SAP-induced rats downregulated the DNA binding activity of the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB) and the expressions of MMP-9 and ICAM-1 in lung.

{"human":"        WARNING : THE FOLLOWING EVENTS ARE TRUE.       Sigthings 3 : Teachers from Hell.    Incognitos spotted a commotion outside the Auditorium. Situated at the 1 st floor, it was a place where functions were held. As it was a multi-purpose building, it was currently in use for examinations. Upon further enquiries, it turned out that the students enrolled in the Centre for Pre-University Studies were having their term and also trials for the upcoming Cambridge A-Levels examination. Consequently, or maybe not, high levels of abnormality was recorded in our electromagnetic wave device. We then went closer, for a through examination of the events ongoing while the students sweated out in the dark, unfriendly atmosphere...  'That teacher was born and raised in hell!! 'Precisely, how are we suppose to complete a paper with 2 hours worth of question within an hour?' .....'I couldn't finish that #$*%ing paper!' 'She purposely did it....remember what she said...'I would give you 2 long questions where you have to balance accounts with no objective questions...how's that? It would be easy! ' 'Those accounts couldn't be balanced....I'm going to fail it....' 'Oh screw it man!'  Not far away, we heard another group of students..  'Sir, there's no time. How can you do this sir?! 'Was it hard?' 'No, in can be done, but, there was NO TIME!' 'Sir,....our grades, 100% from this paper?' 'Yah...' 'NO, sir....NO!' And with a sly smile, he said, 'Just take this as an experience, go back home and try it out again...we will see how...this paper....' and left, with the doors swinging back. 'How could he do this, I DIDN'T complete so many questions!'   In another case,  'I'm so tense, how the hell am I suppose to hold this up? I missed an exam because of some time table mix-up. Ms(--) told me that this paper would be now, but when I went there, the place was empty', 'Oh, another classic case of teachers from hell...' 'NO...SHE WAS BORN AND RAISED IN HELL!' 'You should calm down, you got another test in 10 minutes...' 'Gosh! I'm so dead man, so DEAD!'

Many complained of being dead and only present in a vaguest way possible. Incognitos found this an interesting fact. In many conversations that we overheard, many references were made about death and the cycle of life, in rather interesting ways. For example :   1) I booked the incinerator last week and decided to keep my date with it after physics paper. 2) What are you guys talking about?..huh..amoebic movement...multinucleic? I'm in the    twilight zone right now.... 3) Twinkle, twinkle little star, how I wonder how close you are... 4) I am so dead,I'm twelve feet underneath.. 5) I would be lucky if I could see the day light 6) -I am dead -If you're dead, I'm already eaten and digested by animals -And through amonification, I'm already a nitrate -You can't beat this! I'm denitrified and already in the air as N2 (nitrogen gas)      Point  : The students still managed humour although they claimed to be dead.

{"human":"It all began when I followed her home. We met at a party and just seemed to hit it off. There was something just a little different, intriguing about how she presented herself, but I'll be dammed if I could put a finger on it... \n \n Soon, we were dating and she would speak often of her little home down in the middle of nowhere. The sights, people, atmosphere seemed near perfect, and I at times wondered if she were not just romanticizing it all, like so many of us do when thinking about happier, younger times. \n \n One day, she just said it: `` Forget this job. Marry me and let's go home!'' \n \n `` Are you fucking kidding me? ``, I said. \n \n `` No. Why not? It's not like you have a lot going here, is it?'' \n \n `` well no, but... I ca n't just up and LEAVE?'' `` Can I?'' \n \n `` Great! Then it's settled! Give your two weeks, and we can pack up the good stuff, sell the rest and start a new life, fresh and out of this ugly city. I ca n't wait to tell Beth. She's going to be so excited! `` \n \n Now I had heard of this Beth creature a time or two, a childhood friend equally in love with her little town, what was it called? \n \n Oh yeah, Blisdren. Strange name. Not sure I've heard that one before. \n \n... Two weeks later: \n \n `` Come on! Let's get going! People are waiting and it's a long drive and I want to get there before dark! ``, she said. \n \n `` Amanda, I'm only going to tell you once! This is hard for me, dammit! I need to make sure of a few things and that's what I'm gon na do. ``, I said. And thought, good grief! What the hell have I gotten into? Maybe I really do n't need this stuff. Ok fine. \n \n `` All done dear! We are on our way!'' \n \n She leaned in for her kiss as I was buckling up, `` I CA N'T WAIT! THANK YOU, THANK YOU...'' \n \n So we arrive in little Blisdren, and I swear it looked like something right out of the movies! There it was, nestled in a valley, sprinkled with rolling hills, just the sort of trees you want to lay under all day long, curled up with a good book, something to drink, and maybe a friend, or lover. Absolutely beautiful! In the distance, snow covered peaks could be seen, right along with a seemingly pure river. \n \n The center of town featured a stone courthouse from what looked like the 1800's, small park, ice cream stand from the 30's, and various other buildings, shops, and the one service station on the end of town by the river. There were a smattering of homes in the area, but most folks lived in the rolling hills, coming into town each day, only to return at night. \n \n Some outbuildings near the edges of town appeared to have some industry, and there were the usual smattering of churches, second hand shops, and one thing I knew I would love right away: An all music store, packed with vinyl, CD, whatever. Sweet! \n \n Our place was just on the other side of town, giving me a good look around as we drove through. The kids were all happy, park clean, people waving, the usual small town stuff. \n \n There was absolutely no garbage at all. \n \n `` YOU MADE IT!!! ``, says a very happy, bubbly Beth. We could hardly escape from the car before she was all over both of us, just brimming with all the news, `` We simply MUST catch up Amanda, and you can introduce your new husband!'' \n \n I let out a sigh, smiled, gave Beth her hug and said, `` Yes, we are here! Thank you for helping get our home all setup for us before we arrived. I'm sure it's just perfect.'' \n \n `` Everything here is Bob. Absolutely everything. ``, said beth with a bigger than life smile. \n \n Since then, it really has been perfect. Nobody got hurt, the biggest crime was some little kids plucking flowers they should not have. I met everybody and soon found work in one of the data centers recently built there. Honestly, the open position was a near clone of my old job, leaving me in this wonderful place, with a woman I loved, living the dream. I could not be happier, but for this little nag I had soon after arriving. \n \n One day, I thought I would call my friend Dave: \n \n `` Hello, Dave?'' \n \n `` Bob, is that you? So glad to hear your voice!'' \n \n `` Yeah, it's me buddy. How are things?'' \n \n `` Well we miss you at work, but everything else is fine. So tell me, how did you settle in?'' \n \n `` It's absolutely perfect here Dave. Absolutely everything.'' \n \n `` Are you OK Bob?'' \n \n `` How so Dave? Yeah, I'm fine. Seriously.'' \n \n `` Well, before you left, you were telling everybody how much you missed them, wondered what finding work was gon na be like, and just seemed a bit more apprehensive. It's only been a couple weeks.'' \n \n `` Really Dave? Wow, seems like I've been here for years. Amanda was right. This place is great. Ca n't believe I almost did n't come.'' \n \n `` Well OK buddy. You take care and give me a call soon.'' \n \n `` Will do, later.'' \n \n For years, I would walk around in awe of how charming, beautiful, just perfect this little town is. And nothing at all ever seems to change, and when it does, nothing stands out. Like we have cell phones, but the towers are nowhere to be found, or there are n't any cracks in the road or sidewalks anywhere at all. Seems like there would be some things like that, but there are n't, and if you think about it too much, something always comes up. You have a neighbor saying, `` Hi'', or maybe something like a stray ball needs your attention. \n \n Every time I try to puzzle through it, I end up distracted, literally made happy, and that is as far as I've ever gotten, but for one day at work. Something outside of town affected the data center, and I stayed late that one day, so the world could connect. And there was this glow... \n\n","LLM_1":"It began the night I followed her home after a party\u2014something about her lingered in my mind, subtle and unplaceable, like a half-remembered dream.

It sounded too perfect, the kind of nostalgia people invent when they want to escape the present.\n\nThen one day she said, \u201cForget this job.

{"human":"Many of the arguments made for why sparse random features are useful in the brain (namely, section 4) have been previously discussed in the literature (namely, refs 20,44,45). The novel contribution of this paper seems to be the connection to additive kernel methods, but it was not clear what this added to the previous theory on sparse and random networks. It is critical that this be made explicit for this work to comprise a valuable contribution to this workshop.\n\nThis paper tries to link the theory of sparse random features and additive kernel functions to feed-foward networks in the brain. The introduction section elegantly reviews previous research on these topics, attempting to directly link experimental findings in the brain to the sparse random feature architecture motivated by machine learning theory and adopted in their proposed model.\n\nWithin the four-page limit, no explicit demonstrations of their arguments from section 4 were made. However, extensive connections to previous literature in the machine learning and theoretical neuroscience literature are made, making their arguments relatively convincing. A critical piece missing is explicit connections to previous theory on this subject. For example, how do their scaling results on the number of neurons (namely, the \"claim\" in section 3) relate to those of reference 45?\n\nThe overall subject of this paper seems important and novel enough to merit discussion at this workshop, but as it currently stands this paper does not clearly establish its contribution to this workshop. That said, I believe it is a simple matter of addressing the critiques made above. It is understandable that much of this could not be addressed within the four-page limit. In particular, it is my view that the connection to the kernel methods literature needs to be stated more clearly so as to be accessible to the more neuroscience-oriented audience of this workshop. The novel contribution of additive kernels to the theory of sparse random networks - a topic studied at length in the theoretical neuroscience literature - needs to be made explicit and clear.\n\nIt seems like there are two separate ideas in this paper:\n1) sparse random features are useful in feed-forward networks (section 4)\n2) sparse random features implement additive kernels\nThe novelty of this paper presumably lies in the connection between these two ideas. While each of these was clearly explained, their connection was not at all clear to this reviewer. It is possible this is due to limited knowledge of the kernel methods literature.","LLM_1":"The paper attempts to link sparse random features and additive kernel methods to feed-forward neural networks in the brain, building on prior work (e.g., refs 20, 44, 45) that has already discussed the utility of sparse random features in neuroscience contexts. While the introduction effectively synthesizes findings from machine learning and theoretical neuroscience, the novel contribution\u2014specifically, the connection to additive kernel methods\u2014remains insufficiently clarified. It is not explicitly stated how this connection advances existing theory on sparse and random networks, nor how the scaling arguments in Section 3 relate to previous results such as those in reference 45.\n\nAlthough the paper makes extensive connections to the literature within the four-page limit, it lacks a clear articulation of its unique contribution. The two core ideas\u2014(1) the usefulness of sparse random features in feed-forward networks and (2) their implementation of additive kernels\u2014are individually well-motivated, but their integration is not clearly explained. The significance of linking these concepts, particularly for a neuroscience-oriented audience, must be made more explicit.\n\nFor the paper to constitute a valuable contribution to the workshop, the authors must clearly delineate how their framework extends prior theoretical understanding. In particular, the implications of additive kernels for network scaling, representation, or computational efficiency in the brain should be directly contrasted with earlier models. Clarifying this connection would strengthen the paper\u2019s impact and better justify its relevance to ongoing discussions in theoretical neuroscience.","LLM_2":"The paper seeks to bridge sparse random features and additive kernel methods with feed-forward neural network architectures in the brain, building on prior work (e.g., refs 20, 44, 45) that has explored the role of sparse random connectivity in neuroscience.

The manuscript does not clearly articulate how this connection advances existing theories of sparse and random networks, nor does it explicitly explain how the scaling arguments presented in Section 3 extend or differ from prior results, such as those in reference 45.\n\nDespite extensive engagement with the literature within the space constraints, the paper falls short in articulating a distinct and cohesive contribution. The two central components\u2014(1) the utility of sparse random features in feed-forward circuits and (2) their realization of additive kernels\u2014are individually supported by existing evidence, but the integration of these ideas lacks clarity. In particular, the conceptual leap from sparse random connectivity to additive kernel computation\u2014and its functional significance in neural systems\u2014remains underdeveloped.\n\nTo strengthen its impact and better position itself within the theoretical neuroscience discourse, the paper must more clearly define how the proposed framework extends current understanding. Specifically, the authors should explicitly contrast the implications of additive kernels for neural scaling, representational capacity, or computational efficiency with those of earlier models. A clearer exposition of this theoretical advancement would enhance the paper\u2019s originality, clarify its relevance to biological networks, and better justify its inclusion in the workshop.","op1":"refine","op2":"rewrite","domain":"openreview","model":"Qwen"}

State media described the country as \u201cengulfed in indescribable sadness,\u201d broadcasting images of weeping citizens and wailing officials as the reclusive regime confirmed the leader\u2019s death at age 69.\n\nThe Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) attributed his death to overwork and complications from longstanding health issues, stating he collapsed at 08:30 local time. The announcement, delayed by more than two days, sparked an outpouring of public grief across the capital, with crowds seen sobbing in the streets and party members pounding desks in anguish during televised tributes.\n\nKim Jong-un, the youngest son of the late leader and widely believed to be in his late twenties, has been formally elevated as the head of the funeral committee\u2014a key signal of his ascension to power. A state funeral is scheduled for December 28, with a national mourning period declared from December 17 to 29. KCNA hailed Kim Jong-un as the \u201cgreat successor\u201d and called on all party members, military forces, and citizens to unite under his leadership, emphasizing continuity and stability.\n\nLittle is publicly known about Kim Jong-un, who received part of his education in Switzerland and was only introduced to the public as heir apparent just over a year ago. His rapid rise comes amid deep uncertainty about North Korea\u2019s political future, particularly given his lack of experience and the opaque nature of succession within the ruling Workers\u2019 Party.\n\nThe news triggered immediate reactions across the region. South Korea raised its military readiness level and urged calm among its population, while Japan convened an emergency cabinet meeting on national security. In Washington, President Barack Obama consulted with South Korean President Lee Myung-bak, reaffirming the U.S. commitment to regional stability and alliance defense. China, Pyongyang\u2019s closest ally and primary economic lifeline, expressed shock and pledged continued support for peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula.\n\nFinancial markets in Asia reacted cautiously, with modest declines in equities following the announcement. Unconfirmed reports from Seoul suggested a short-range missile launch off North Korea\u2019s east coast may have occurred shortly before the death was made public, though South Korean officials played down any direct link and declined further comment.\n\nAnalysts warn of potential instability during the transition. With Kim Jong-il no longer able to oversee the upcoming 2012 centenary of his father Kim Il-sung\u2019s birth\u2014a major ideological milestone\u2014his son now inherits both the symbolic mantle and the pressure to consolidate authority. Some experts suggest internal power struggles could lead to external provocations aimed at rallying domestic unity.\n\n\u201cLeadership transitions in authoritarian regimes are inherently risky,\u201d said former U.S. diplomat Christopher Hill, who led nuclear negotiations with North Korea. \u201cNow is the time for calm and vigilance.\u201d British Foreign Secretary William Hague described the moment as a possible turning point, urging the international community to remain engaged.\n\nKim Jong-il assumed power in 1994 after the death of his father, North Korea\u2019s founding leader Kim Il-sung. His rule was marked by widespread famine that claimed an estimated two million lives, systematic human rights abuses, and increasing international isolation due to the country\u2019s pursuit of nuclear weapons. Despite multiple rounds of sanctions, he oversaw two nuclear tests\u2014in 2006 and 2009\u2014and repeatedly defied global efforts toward denuclearization. Multilateral talks remain frozen.\n\nHis health had been a subject of speculation since he suffered a stroke in 2008, but his death still reverberated across the region, underscoring the fragility of one of the world\u2019s most closed regimes.

{"human":"The role of the serotonin receptor 4 (5-HT4R) pathway in cardiac excitation-contraction coupling (ECC) remains unclear.

{"human":"Contactless cards allow people to wave a card near a retailer's reader to pay without entering a four-digit Pin.\nResearchers for consumer group Which? used a reader and decoding software to grab a card number and expiry date from cards, raising concern about theft.\nBut a card industry trade body said fraud levels on contactless were low.\nThe Which? researchers said they gathered enough detail to buy items, including a \u00c2\u00a33,000 TV, on the internet using these card details.\nThey said that although the risks were low, it would be possible for somebody standing very close to \"lift\" card details without the owner knowing.\nHowever, wrapping the card in tin foil, or putting it in a foil-lined wallet would guard against this.\nRichard Koch, head of policy at the UK Cards Association, said: \"The method shown by Which? is not a new discovery and was first reported two years ago. However, any such technology can only obtain the card number and expiry date - information that has always been available simply by looking at the front of a card.\n\"The vast majority of online retailers require additional data such as the card security code, along with the cardholder's address, which cannot be harvested electronically. Any retailers that do not will do so at their own risk and will be liable for any fraudulent transactions.\"\nSome retailers ask for other information, other than the three-digit security code on the back of a card.\n\"Instances of fraud on contactless cards are in fact extremely rare, with losses of less than a penny for every \u00c2\u00a3100 spent on contactless - far lower even than overall card fraud,\" Mr Koch said.\nHe added that consumers were fully protected against any fraud losses on contactless cards and would never be left out of pocket.\nCard providers should reimburse victims of contactless fraud, assuming victims acted reasonably to keep their card safe.\nNew technology is allowing consumers to use a smartphone or smartwatch to make tap-and-go payments.\nFirms adopting the technology are also marketing it as being a more secure alternative to physical payment cards because of their use of a technique called \"tokenization\".\nApple Pay is based on the system, and both Google Pay and Samsung Pay are set to adopt it when they launch soon.\nSo how does it work?\nIn the case of Apple Pay, the US firm requires participating banks and payment networks involved to create two new elements:\nThe token and encryption key are installed into a dedicated chip on the devices, which their operating systems cannot access.\nTo authorise an in-store sale, the device's token and an associated cryptogram are transmitted via the contactless terminal to the payment provider, who checks they belong together.\nEven if a thief did manage to intercept the information, they could not re-use the token without knowing a way to make new matching cryptograms.\nThis is similar to way banks protect their online accounts by issuing customers with card readers that generate time-limited codes.\nJust as criminals are not able to access online accounts by typing in a user's membership number without a corresponding authentication code, so are they unable to use a stolen smartphone token without a related cryptogram.\nFurthermore, there is no easy way to reverse-engineer a token to reveal the original payment card's details.\nEven if Apple's own servers were hacked, it does not store the complete account number itself.","LLM_1":"Contact-less cards enable users to tap a device near an reader at a store to complete a payment without inputing a PIN. \n\nHowever concerns have been raised after Which?'s researchers used software and a contact-less reader, claiming they can steal card numbers and expiration dates, allowing them to purchase items online, such a \u00a33k TV. They also said a person could steal details from a nearby card without its owner's knowledge, though they noted this risk was low.\n\nTo protect against such thefts, experts suggest wrapping a phone in tinfoil or storing it a metal-lined case.\n\nRichard Kok, UK Card Association head, countered that the technique is old, discovered two year ago,  and that retailers already require other details, like the security card code and card holder's information.\n\nHe said contact less card losses are extremely low - less then 1p for \u00a3100 in contact - and noted that card providers would reimburse consumers for contact fraud if they acted responsibly to protect cards.\n\nNew tech is emerging to allow contact payments via smartphones and smartwatches. Firms like Apple are marketing the method as more securable than physical cards due to a process called tokenization, where a unique token is created and used to authorse payments, making it harder for thieves to steal sensitive information. Even if the info was intercepted, a criminal would need to know how to generate matching codes to re use the stolen token. Similar to how banks generate one time codes for online transactions, this method ensures that a criminals cannot use stolen information to commit fraud. Furthermore, reversing the unique tokens to obtain original card information is also impossible. Apple also doesn't store complete card account numbers on its servers. Some retailers also ask other security information beyond the standard three digit security number on a standard card. This further reduces the risk of card theft. As such, contact payment methods are increasingly being adopted and seen as a secure option.","LLM_2":"Contactless cards allow users a seamless payment experience, enabling them simply to wave their device in front of a reader to finalize a transaction without the need for a Personal Identification Number (PIN).\n\nHowever, concerns about the technology's security have surfaced after researchers at Which? discovered a vulnerability using software in conjunction with a Contactless reader. According to their findings, it is theoretically possible for hackers to pilfer card details and use them for illicit online purchases, including a hypothetical \u00a33000 TV.\n\nAdditionally, they warned that it may be feasible for an individual to discreetly obtain sensitive details about a card from its nearby owner without their knowledge. Although they acknowledged that this threat is relatively low, caution is warranted.\n\nIndustry experts recommend taking measures to safeguard against this type of theft, suggesting that users wrap their phones in foil or store them in metal cases.\n\nHowever Richard Kok of UK Cards Association countered, stating that these security risks are nothing new and have existed for two years. He noted further that merchants already request additional security measures, which include the card's three-digit security code as well as the owner\u2019s information, thereby rendering the potential security breach futile.\n\nMr. Kok emphasized that contactless card fraud rates are minuscule, at less than 0.1% for every \u00a31,000 spent using contact methods. Moreover, he assured that if consumers act responsibly and take necessary precautions to secure their cards, card issuers would provide reimbursement in the event of contact-related fraud.\n\nAs contact-based payments continue to evolve, new technologies are emerging that allow consumers to use their smartphones or smartwatch to facilitate transactions. Companies such as Apple market this payment method, citing its enhanced security features due in part to tokenisation. In this process, each transaction generates a one-of-a-kind token, further obscuring sensitive card data. Consequently, even if a malicious actor intercepted this information during transmission, generating matching tokens and using them would be practically impossible.\n\nFurthermore, Apple ensures the integrity of these tokens by not storing complete account information on their servers, rendering it impossible for malicious actors to reverse-engineer the original data from the tokens. Retailers, too, have taken proactive measures by requesting additional forms of security beyond just the three-digits security PIN, thus further reducing the likelihood of successful card breaches. Ultimately, these advancements have positioned contact-enabled payments as an increasingly secure and trusted option for consumers.","op1":"refine","op2":"polish","domain":"xsum","model":"llama"}

The writing of this article is not clear\n\nQ1.1 This article contains too much information, the author has too many things to say. But the main contribution is not described clearly. I suggest the author use a few sentences to describe the core contribution of this article and write it in the first part. List by points.\n\nQ1.2 The framework of this method seems complex. It is suggested to insert a diagram on the second page and highlight the core contribution.\n\nQ2. The necessity of introducing EA\n\nQ2.1 What is the meaning of introducing EA algorithm? What are the unique advantages of local population strategy in EA algorithm? Why is it useful to introduce local information because EA is similar to transformer? In my opinion, the introduction of EA algorithm has some over packaging.\n\nQ2.2 Again local? The purpose of introducing transformer into CV task is to deal with the image information directly in a uniform way, without considering the sequence relationship between the image patches, and deal with the problem of CV from a global perspective. This article seems to reuse some features of images, such as local information and sequence to transformer? This sounds like considering some special features of the image and used in the transformer. I don't think it's bad, but I think it might be contrary to the original intention of the transformer.\n\nQ3. Method & Experiments\n\nQ3.1 Please report the FLOPs.\n\nQ3.2 Please add all the Efficientnet models in Fig. 6. It seems that the improvement is incremental.\n\nQ3.3 About local. It actually introduces some priors of CNN's local information into transformer to a certain extent. The idea of local is not new and needs to quote more relevant papers.\n\nQ3.4 About SFC. If the input image is not a regular rectangle, what is the impact? Is the strategy adopted by the author the optimal one for 2D image arrangement?\n\n========== post rebuttal ============\n\nI have read the rebuttal and the rebuttal addresses most of my concerns. I will change my score from 4 to 6.\n\nThe rebuttal should be merged into main paper in the next version.","LLM_1":"**Pros:**  \n- The paper demonstrates a certain degree of innovation.  \n- The results are strong and promising.  \n\n**Cons:**  \n- **Clarity and presentation issues:** The writing lacks clarity and contains excessive information, obscuring the main contribution. The authors should concisely summarize the core contribution in a few bullet points at the beginning of the paper to improve readability and focus.  \n- **Method complexity:** The proposed framework appears complex. A diagram on the second page illustrating the overall architecture and highlighting the key innovations would significantly improve understanding.  \n- **Justification for EA integration:** The motivation for introducing the evolutionary algorithm (EA) is unclear. The authors should clarify: (1) the specific purpose of incorporating EA; (2) the advantages of its local population strategy; and (3) why leveraging local information is beneficial given that EA shares similarities with Transformers. Currently, the use of EA risks appearing as over-engineering.  \n- **Conceptual concern regarding locality:** Transformers were introduced in computer vision to model global interactions without relying on local priors. By reintroducing local structures and sequential dependencies\u2014such as image patch sequences and local features\u2014the work partially reverts to CNN-like inductive biases. While not inherently flawed, this contradicts the original intent of Transformer-based modeling and requires deeper justification.  \n- **Missing technical details:**  \n  - Report the FLOPs of the proposed method.  \n  - Include all EfficientNet variants in Fig. 6 to better contextualize the performance gains, which currently appear incremental.  \n  - The idea of incorporating local information into Transformers is not novel. The authors should cite and discuss relevant prior work that explores similar hybrid designs.  \n  - Regarding the SFC strategy: what is its behavior when handling non-rectangular images? Is the current 2D arrangement optimal for general image layouts? This requires clarification.  \n\n**Post-rebuttal note:**  \nThe rebuttal adequately addresses most concerns. As such, I have increased my score from 4 to 6. The authors are strongly encouraged to incorporate the rebuttal content into the next version of the manuscript for improved clarity and completeness.","LLM_2":"**\n\nThe paper presents a novel approach with notable innovation and promising empirical results. While the technical contribution is of interest, several concerns regarding clarity, methodological justification, and presentation must be addressed to strengthen the impact and accessibility of the work.\n\n**Strengths:**\n- The paper exhibits a meaningful degree of originality in its design and conceptual framing.\n- Experimental results are strong and demonstrate competitive performance, suggesting practical potential.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Clarity and organization:** The manuscript suffers from unclear exposition and information overload, which obscures the core contributions. To improve readability, the authors should provide a concise, bullet-point summary of the key ideas and innovations at the beginning of the paper\u2014this would help orient readers and emphasize the central message.\n  \n- **Methodological complexity:** The proposed framework is technically intricate, and its overall structure is not immediately accessible. Including a clear architectural diagram on the second page\u2014highlighting the main components and their interactions\u2014would greatly enhance comprehension and highlight the critical innovations.\n\n- **Motivation for evolutionary algorithm (EA) integration:** The rationale for incorporating EA remains underdeveloped. The authors need to more clearly articulate: (1) the specific role EA plays in the framework; (2) how its local population strategy offers advantages over global search or other optimization mechanisms; and (3) why leveraging localized evolutionary dynamics is beneficial, especially given the structural similarities between EA processes and self-attention mechanisms in Transformers. Without stronger justification, the inclusion of EA risks being perceived as unnecessarily complex or *ad hoc*.\n\n- **Conceptual tension around locality:** A key motivation behind Vision Transformers has been the move away from local inductive biases (e.g., those inherent in CNNs) toward modeling long-range dependencies. This work reintroduces locality through patch sequencing and local feature propagation, effectively re-incorporating CNN-like assumptions. While hybrid models are valid, this design choice represents a conceptual shift that should be explicitly acknowledged and justified. The authors should discuss whether this reintroduction of locality improves performance at the cost of undermining one of the foundational principles of Transformer-based vision models.\n\n- **Insufficient technical details and contextualization:**\n  - The computational cost of the method should be reported, including FLOPs or similar efficiency metrics.\n  - Figure 6 should include all EfficientNet variants to better position the performance gains\u2014currently, the improvement appears marginal without full context.\n  - The idea of integrating local structures into Transformers is not new. The authors must cite and engage with prior work on hybrid CNN-Transformer architectures to properly situate their contribution within the existing literature.\n  - Regarding the SFC (Spatial Feature Construction) strategy: clarification is needed on how it handles non-rectangular inputs or irregular image aspect ratios. Additionally, the optimality of the current 2D arrangement for diverse image layouts should be discussed.\n\n**Post-rebuttal note:**  \nThe authors have provided satisfactory responses to most of the raised concerns during the rebuttal phase. As a result, I have increased my score from 4 to 6. I strongly encourage them to integrate the clarifications offered in the rebuttal directly into the revised manuscript to ensure completeness, transparency, and improved readability for future readers.","op1":"refine","op2":"rewrite","domain":"openreview","model":"Qwen"}

Pure Land Buddhism is a very widespread and perhaps the most faith-orientated manifestation of Buddhism and centres upon the conviction that faith in Amitabha Buddha and the chanting of homage to his name liberates one at death into the Blissful (\u5b89\u6a02), Pure Land (\u6de8\u571f) of Amitabha Buddha.

The primary trial outcome was total energy of intended food purchase.A total of 329 participants completed the follow-up telephone interview. Eighty-two percent of the energy labelling group and 96% of the single traffic light labelling group reported noticing labelling information on their menu.

{"human":"\n \n I was reluctant to accept the assignment but my manager insisted the interview would attract readers, despite the risk. I drove 6 hours to find myself in the distant rolling hills of King Ferry, upstate New York. About an hour outside of Ithaca the region was scarcely populated, but the scenery was remarkable with Cayuga lake in the impressive backdrop. \n \n I met with Dr. Banner on his 6 acre farm oddly dubbed \u201c Happy Hills Farm. \u201d The name, however, made ominous by the copious \u201c No Trespassing & Beware of Dog \u201d signs. There were no dogs. When I mentioned the signs- Dr. Banner simply remarked- \u201c It doesn \u2019 t put people off, but it keeps kids out. \u201d \n \n He lead a humble life of seclusion on the charming plot, housing several horses, cows, goats, pigs and free roaming chickens. While he was showing me the coop, he was particularly proud of for its new reinforced barbed wire fence, I noticed a rather large disturbance in the earth nearby, leading to the woods. I was fairly certain no farm equipment could produce such wreckage, as farm equipment seldom left large footprints. Dr. Banner noticed my ogling and, with modest regret, informed me that coyotes had found their way into the coop several days ago. \n \n When I asked what happened to them, he replied- \u201c Lost 4 hens that night. \u201d \n \n \u201c No\u2026to the Coyotes? \u201d \n \n \u201c Well let \u2019 s just say they didn \u2019 t come back. I woke up down by the lake if you must ask. \u201d he added that last bit with a bit of apprehension. \n \n \u201c So I guess the fence is more metaphorical now \u201d I said \n \n He solemnly conceited \u201c Yea, I guess so. \u201d It was obvious I had offended him. His pride and excitement came from the newly reinforced fence, and I had denied him the simple satisfaction. It must be difficult for a ex-nuclear physicist to demote themselves to elementary labor. I quickly changed the topic to the animals. \n \n \u201c How many cows do you have? \u201d \n \n \u201c 8 for now, Cobalt over there is 4 months pregnant, so we \u2019 ll be expecting one soon. That \u2019 s Osmium, that \u2019 s Argon, and that \u2019 s Astatine. \u201d \n \n The little part of him lusting for science that appeared diminished, was intact by his sense of humor. He named nearly every farm animal after a chemical element. He showed me around his stable where several horses were feeding. Then out to the pasture where the cows were grazing. It was there Banner offered me a lesson on how to properly milk a cow. During the lesson we managed to fill three buckets. \n \n But, during the lesson, the cow Dr. Banner was milking took a step back onto his foot. Whilst attempting to free himself from the crushing weight of the cow he stepped in one of the buckets, collapsing to the muddy pasture and spilling over the rest. Covered in mud, cow-pies, and milk I was not prepared for what followed. \n \n Now dear readers let me make it clear that I have no shame in admitting that I was petrified by what happened next. For I have never seen cows run so fast. Never seen horses break free from their stalls, or see chickens fly. But I had witnessed all of those things at once. And I saw a man enlarge 5 times his size in a matter of seconds, while changing pigmentation. \n \n Dr. Banner however, angry as he was, somehow managed to slow the sudden growth spirt down just before its climax. With deep, heavy, and I suspect, practiced inhalations his size and color returned to its normal human form before all was lost. While I stood there shaking, soiled, and moderately sobbing, I watched a man return from a beast with zen-like breathing. \n \n After Dr. Banner came too, he very calmly turned towards me, half naked, and said \u201c Care for some lunch? \u201d \n \n He made fresh omelets from his chickens, with chives, tomatoes, carrots, and peppers from his garden. Cooking suited him well, and although he failed to replace his tattered clothes with new ones, I paid no mind, I was still in shock. \n \n \u201c How did you come to control your, anger? \u201d I asked \n \n He slowly sipped at his tea and thought considerably for a moment before answering. \u201c I chose to live out here in seclusion so that I wouldn \u2019 t put myself in a position where I could hurt someone, or something. But with all the routine maintenance of running a farm its easy to get frustrated and the trivialities that occur once in a while. \u201d \n \n \u201c But the breathing, was that a technique or? \u201d \n \n \u201c It was a form of mediation I acquired from a Buddhist before I came here, its really life changing you should try it. \u201d \n \n \u201c I should \u201d with that I earned my first smile from Dr. Banner. Life was simple on his farm and with a very normal handshake I said my goodbyes and made my way off the property. \n \n I don \u2019 t know if I would ever venture to guess whether Dr. Banner was truly happy on his farm, but Im willing to say he is content, for now.\n","LLM_1":"I hesitated when my manager assigned me the interview\u2014risky, he said, but sure to draw readers.

The aim of the present study was to clarify the role of ceramide-LMIR3 interaction in the development of IBD.The dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis model was used in wild-type (WT), LMIR3(-\/-), mast cell-deficient Kit(W-sh\/W-sh), Kit(W-sh\/W-sh)LMIR3(-\/-) or Kit(W-sh\/W-sh) mice engrafted with WT or LMIR3(-\/-) bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs). The severity of colitis was determined by clinical and histological criteria. Lamina propria cell populations were assessed by flow cytometry. Production of chemical mediators from lamina propria cells was measured by real-time reverse transcription PCR. Production of chemical mediators from ATP-stimulated BMMCs in the presence or absence of ceramide was measured by ELISA. The severity of DSS-induced colitis was assessed in mice given either an Fc fusion protein containing an extracellular domain of LMIR3, and anticeramide antibody, or ceramide liposomes.LMIR3 deficiency exacerbated DSS-induced colitis in mice. Kit(W-sh\/W-sh) mice harbouring LMIR3(-\/-) mast cells exhibited more severe colitis than those harbouring WT mast cells. Ceramide-LMIR3 interaction inhibited ATP-stimulated activation of BMMCs. DSS-induced colitis was aggravated by disrupting the ceramide-LMIR3 interaction, whereas it was suppressed by treating with ceramide liposomes.","LLM_1":"Extracellular ATP promotes mast cell\u2013dependent intestinal inflammation through P2X7 purinoceptors.

{"human":"Budding yeast is a unique model for exploring differential fate in a cell dividing asymmetrically. In yeast, spindle orientation begins with the old spindle pole body (SPB) (from the preceding cell cycle) contacting the bud by its existing astral microtubules (aMTs) while the new pole delays astral microtubule organization. This appears to prime the inheritance of the old pole by the bud. The basis for this asymmetry and the discrimination of the poles by virtue of their history remain a mystery.Here, we report that asymmetric aMT organization stems from an outstanding structural asymmetry linked to the SPB cycle. We show that the \u03b3-tubulin nucleation complex (\u03b3TC) favors the old spindle pole, an asymmetry inherent to the outer plaque (the cytoplasmic face of the SPB). Indeed, Spc72 (the receptor for the \u03b3TC) is acquired by the new SPB outer plaque partway through spindle assembly. The significance of this asymmetry was explored in cells expressing an Spc72(1-276)-Cnm67 fusion that forced symmetric nucleation at the SPB outer plaques. This manipulation triggered simultaneous aMT organization by both spindle poles from the outset and led to symmetric contacts between poles and the bud, effectively disrupting the program for spindle polarity. Temporally symmetric aMT organization perturbed Kar9 polarization by randomizing the choice of the pole to be guided toward the bud. Accordingly, the pattern of SPB inheritance was also randomized.","LLM_1":"Budding yeast serves as a valuable model for studying asymmetric cell division.

{"human":"In this paper, authors proposed a deep multi-agent reinforcement learning framework which adapts to complex condition of aircraft on route conflicting. Due to the interaction effect of different agents, authors consider the nearest N agents according to the distance and full loss of separation distance. The reflection of this is dynamic reward function. For the action, authors design a balanced speed with range of minimum and maximum allowed cruise speed.\nFrom the overall point of view, the framework could accommodate the complicated and changeable environment which integrates dynamic change among different agents and the relation among current agent and other agents. In the real world, there would be multiple agents with disparate conditions which would show effects on the decision of flying at each time point. Authors also take that in consideration.\nHowever, there are also some details need to be specified or improved.\nFirstly, authors emphasize the aircrafts on conflicting route should not be reached the interaction due to the meaningless of considering already passed intersection. However, in real world, aircrafts would be interacted multiple times during the whole airline. It depends on the degree of deviation and their subsequent changes which interact with environment. So this hypothesis would be somehow a little strong.\nSecondly, as a possible aspect for improvement, some external environmental change caused by some other settings such as clouds and airflow would also influence the actions and environment in real air traffic scene. So it would be better to incorporate factors which reflect these scenes.\nFinally, for the settings, aircraft should have the ability to select speed in the range between minimum allowed cruise speed and maximum allowed cruise speed instead of just three desired speeds. In real life, speed would be changeable according to the environment. So there should be a rule for describing the change such as weight decaying or some other methods.","LLM_1":"The paper proposes a deep multi-agent reinforcement learning framework designed to handle complex aircraft route conflicts by considering interactions among agents based on proximity and separation loss, reflected through a dynamic reward function. Actions are determined via a balanced speed policy constrained within the allowable cruise speed range. The framework effectively captures dynamic inter-agent dependencies and adapts to evolving environments, accounting for real-world scenarios involving multiple agents with heterogeneous states influencing each decision point.\n\nHowever, several aspects require clarification or improvement. First, while the authors assume that aircraft on conflicting routes should not interact after passing an intersection\u2014deeming such interactions irrelevant\u2014this assumption may be overly restrictive. In practice, aircraft may re-encounter one another due to trajectory deviations or subsequent environmental adjustments, making repeated interactions plausible and context-dependent.\n\nSecond, the model could be enhanced by incorporating external environmental factors such as weather conditions (e.g., clouds, airflow), which significantly influence real-world air traffic dynamics and control decisions. Integrating such elements would improve the framework\u2019s realism and robustness.\n\nLastly, the current action space limits speed selection to three discrete values. For greater fidelity, aircraft should be able to select continuous speeds within the minimum and maximum allowed cruise speeds, reflecting real operational flexibility. A mechanism to model adaptive speed changes\u2014such as through weighted decay rules or other principled methods\u2014should be specified to better represent dynamic flight behavior.","LLM_2":"The paper presents a deep multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for resolving complex aircraft route conflicts by modeling agent interactions through proximity-based relationships and a dynamic separation loss function, which together shape the reward structure. Decisions are guided by a balanced speed policy constrained within feasible cruise speed limits. The approach effectively captures evolving inter-agent dependencies and demonstrates adaptability in dynamic, multi-agent environments with heterogeneous states\u2014offering a promising direction for realistic air traffic management.\n\nThat said, several aspects warrant further clarification or enhancement:\n\nFirst, the assumption that aircraft no longer interact after passing an intersection\u2014on the grounds that such post-intersection interactions are deemed irrelevant\u2014may be overly restrictive. In real-world operations, aircraft trajectories can converge again due to deviations, rerouting, or downstream traffic adjustments. Thus, dismissing interactions beyond intersections risks oversimplifying the temporal and spatial complexity of aerial encounters. A more nuanced treatment of interaction persistence, potentially governed by contextual factors like relative heading or predicted future proximity, would strengthen the model\u2019s applicability.\n\nSecond, the current framework does not account for external environmental influences such as weather conditions (e.g., wind shear, turbulence, cloud formations), which play a critical role in both pilot decision-making and traffic flow management. Incorporating such factors could significantly improve the realism and robustness of the simulation environment and lead to more resilient policy learning.\n\nFinally, the action space is limited to three discrete speed settings, which may constrain behavioral fidelity. In practice, aircraft adjust speed continuously within operational bounds.

{"human":"###############################\nSummary:\nThis paper focuses on a new scene understanding task: Weakly-Supervised Scene Graph Grounding. Given the image and a paired scene graph, this task needs to link each scene graph node to an object in the image. Specifically, it regards this problem as a bipartite graph matching problem, and designs a cost function considering both object-class similarity and relation-based similarity. Experiments on two datasets (Visual Genome and Visual Relation Detection) have demonstrated the effectiveness.\n\n################################\nAdvantages:\n+ The paper is the first work to explore the task: Weakly-Supervised Scene Graph Grounding. This task can serve as a crucial preprocessing step for weakly-supervised scene graph generation: After solving this grounding task, the weakly-supervised scene graph generation task can be easily transferred to fully-supervised scene graph generation by regarding the grounding results as ground-truth annotations.\n\n+ The whole paper is well-written and all notations are quite clear.\n\n#################################\nWeaknesses:\n\n- The novelty of the idea for weakly-supervised scene graph grounding is limited. It regards this grounding task as a bipartite graph matching problem, which is very similar to the existing work for weakly-supervised scene graph parsing (ie, VSPNet). \n\n- Although this paper is the first work to explore weakly-supervised scene graph grounding task, the task is very similar to the existing weakly-supervised phrase grounding task.\n\n- The comparisons between the proposed method and baselines are not fair. For example, in Table 1, for the baseline WS-VRD [Baldassarre et al., 2020] model, it only utilizes predicates as input for weakly-supervised learning, while the proposed model uses the whole scene graph as input.\n\n- The details of some experiments are not clear. For example, for the compared baseline VSPNet [Zareian et al., 2020a], the authors use two variants of models (VSPNet-v1 and VSPNet-v2), but the details of these two variants are not clear, ie, how to change an scene graph parsing model (VSP) for the scene graph grounding task.\n","LLM_1":"This work introduces Weak-Signal Supervised Scene graph Ground, a novel task that involves linking scene graphs to objects in images.

Firstly, Weak-signal Supervised is a precursor to weak-supil scene generation and can facilitate a smooth transfer to full-supervision by treating grounding outputs as annotations. Secondly, its well-structured writing and clear notation make it accessible to readers. Lastly, as the pioneer in this field,  it has the potential to serve a stepping stone for future research.\n\nHowever, several limitations are noted. While the novelty of Weak- signal Supervision is somewhat limited, being similar in essence to existing methods, such as VSN,, the similarity to other existing tasks, like weak-supv phrse grounding, raises questions about its distinctiveness. Furthermore, unfair comparisons are made between proposed and baseline methods.  For instance, Table, where WS-VRD uses only predicates, whereas the  proposed approach uses a full scene grap. Additionally, some experiment details are unclear, particularly in regards to V-SNet's variants and how they differ from the standard scene parsing approach. These issues need to be addressed to strengthen the paper. \nThe authors' approach has some limitations, including limited novelty and similarities to related tasks.

First, by introducing the Weak-sup scene grounding as an intermediate step, enabling a seamless transfer from weak to strong supervision. Second, through clear and concise writing, making the concepts accessible. Third, pioneering the field. However, there are some concerns: \n\n1. Limited novelty: Similar to prior work on scene parse, using biparte graph matches.\n2. Similarity to Weak-phr ground task raises question about the distinctness of WS-sup ground.\n3.

{"human":"The study presents a new framework for zero-filled MRI reconstruction. The framework is built on a two-way backbone, simultaneously processing from its Laplacian pyramid decomposition and a downsampled version of the input signal. It is built in an end-to-end deep learning model involving complex convolutions. Experiments are performed on an in-house dataset with 2D images from 22 patients, on which the proposed approach is reported with the best performances compared to state-of-the-art community approaches. Substantial effort is done to formulate the studied problem. There are great visual supports including deep learning architecture pipeline and sample results. Authors also make efforts to explain the theoretical bases of the components used in their approach, such as complex convolutions or complex Laplacian pyramid decomposition. Experiments report conventional measures for this task. From an evaluation perspective, all results are derived from an in-house dataset which makes the paper unreproducible. Most importantly, there does not seem to be any validation set, while the paper proposes a new architecture (i.e. an optimization hyper-parameter). The paper suggests that experiments are on 2D images, while competing approaches such as KIKI-Net report experiments on 3D images. If experiments are on 2D, authors should specify whether the training\/testing split was done patient-wise or if images from a patient can be in both sets. How have the training set and testing sets been used? The split between training\/testing should be explicit, along with total number of images. There are public datasets suited for the task (cf other community works), which would produce insightful measures comparable to other reported performance and reproducible. Would it be possible to perform experiments on such public dataset, or maybe report generalization performance of the proposed approach? Figures with visual examples could be enhanced with zoomed-in region with results for all benchmarked methods; also, both figures with samples could be merged.

While the authors provide an extensive explanation of their deep architecture and theoretical foundations, several concerns arise from the evaluation and comparison perspectives. Notably, experiments were conducted on in-housed data, which limits reproducibility, as no validation dataset is provided. Moreover, it remains unclear whether training and evaluation sets were split patient-wisely or not. Furthermore, given that the majority of state of-the art methods operate on three-dimensional images and yours is on two-dimensional ones, this inconsistency should have been addressed. Lastly, incorporating experiments using publicly available datasets, would significantly enhance the validity and generalizability of your results, allowing direct comparisons with other approaches in the field. Some minor errors in notation and figure presentation should also be corrected. Overall, with a few adjustments, your paper has great potential to make a significant contribution to MRI image reconstruction techniques. However, addressing these concerns is crucial for a clear and compelling presentation of results and their implications. \n\nThe proposed framework should ideally be evaluated on publicly accessible datasets for better reproductibility and to demonstrate its applicability in real-world scenarios. Additionally, clarity on the data splitting strategy, explicit reporting of key statistics, like the number and distribution of training images is necessary. Finally, minor corrections, including notation consistency and visual clarity of figures, are required for enhancing the overall quality of presentation. With these adjustments in place, I believe the study has a strong foundation to provide valuable insights into the zero- filled MRI imaging reconstruction problem, thus making a meaningful contribution in this area. \nHowever, performing experiments with publicly- available data would be crucial in validating the model's generalisability and applicabilty in different scenarios, providing the necessary evidence to support your claims. Therefore, to strengthen your argument, re-running your model with these publicly-accessible datasets and comparing your performance to existing state- of- the- art models, especially the ones that were tested with three- dimensional images would further enhance your study. Nonetheless, despite the concerns, you're on to something important and this could potentially make an impact in your field with further refinements. Hence, taking these into consideration, will make the presentation more comprehensive and robust. To ensure clarity, a reworded and revised version should consider these points and address them explicitly. This should make your work more impactful and clear to readers, so they can understand the significance of this study and its implications on MRI zero filled image reconstructions. I would appreciate it if you could address the following concerns in future updates. Performing experiments and comparisons on publically available and widely used datasets will demonstrate the applicatility and effectiveness of you proposed method. By doing so, readers will be able to assess the robustness of its performance, compare it with existing techniques and understand how it can solve real world problems. Minor corrections on notation, figures and data presentation will also help to improve the clarity and readability of our paper. These adjustments should provide the reader with clear understanding of what has been achieved, why it was achieved and how. Addressing these will not only strengthen the current work, make it easier for readers to follow and appreciate but also set the stage for further improvements in MRI reconstrction techniques in general. Providing evidence through comparisons and public data will enhance our study's credibility and make its findings more applicable to real scenarios and more transferable to future research. Thus, by incorporating these suggestions, we can ensure the quality and impact of research presented. We can also ensure that readers can better understand our approach and assess its validity. So, considering these, our work should present a comprehensive study, where all the key aspects of MRI zeros filled reconstruction are addressed, its effectiveness is demonstrated and it makes a valuable contribution. Let me rephrase this in one single paragraph:\n\nThe authors present an innovative framework based complex CNNs for MRI zeron-filled image recostruction using Laplacia pyramid. Several concerns emerge from evaluation, specifically experiments conducted in house, limited reprodocibility due to no provided validation data. Also unclear is whether patient wise or image splitting was used. State-of-art methods are generally  30D but yours 20D. Ideally, publicly avaliable datasets should used for evaluation. Key statistics should reported explicitly including number, distribution, training, images used and notation corrections should made. A revised and rephrased version, should address these and present the results in clear manner. That way readers would have better understanding, appreciate and value the contributions of current research and also have clear picture of how and why the research was conducted. After re-reading the comment, here is a revised text that includes only one paragraph: \n\nThis paper presents an original framework using complex deep neural network, leveraging Lapalace pyramid and complex conolutions for zefilled MRI recostructions with impressive results compared with state-art approaches, evaluated using inhouse dataset of 220 patients. Yet, from reprodcibility perspective several issues emerge including lack of validation, unclear data partitioning and inconsistencies with competing methods operating on higher dimensional space. For a stronger argument and better validation of proposed architecture, publicy avalable datasets are suggested to re-run the experiments. Corrections should done in notations and figures. Further evaluation on these publicaly avalaible dataset and addressing the raised concerns will improve comprehensiveness of study presented and strengthen its claims of effectiveness in solving MRI recstruction problems","LLM_2":"Original Review Comment (rewritten):\n\nThis work presents a compelling framework for zero-filled MRI reconstruction using deep learning.

Unclear data split and inconsistent comparison to 3D-based state-of-the-art models hinder the argument. Evaluating the framework on widely available public datasets would strengthen claims and enhance generalization. Correcting minor notation errors and improving figure clarity will further improve presentation quality.

Through a series of experiments using these simpler techniques, the authors show that perhaps the most important mechanism by which BatchNorm improves training, and especially generalization, is by preventing excessive growth of the activations of the layer before the output layer.\n\n## Strengths\n\nThe paper makes a particularly strong case for studying the relationship between the \"embedding norm\" -- the norm of inputs to the final layer of the network -- and successful training\/generalization. It does this by\n\na) showing that use of BatchNorm can implicitly control this norm, especially if weight decay is applied to BatchNorm parameters.\n\nb) showing that in networks trained with BatchNorm, the value of this norm remains much lower than in those trained without BatchNorm.\n\nc) showing that using simple L2 regularization penalty on this norm, its value can be prevented from growing and, in combination with Fixup initialization, networks without BatchNorm can achieve similar generalization performance as those with BatchNorm.\n\nI think this constitutes a good amount of initial evidence that this technique may be useful for both researchers and practitioners.\n\n## Weaknesses\n\nI did not find major weaknesses, though it remains a little puzzling why all the clearly positive results with activation norm penalties matching or outperforming BatchNorm are only obtained on ImageNet. This indicates that perhaps more tasks\/datasets should have been explored by the authors (the paper uses only two datasets).\n\n## Review Summary\n\nDespite the weakness above, I think the results are sufficiently interesting to be published and evaluated by the wider community. I recommend accepting this paper, though results on more diverse tasks and datasets will certainly improve this paper (and my rating).\n\n## Minor comments\n\n- Sec. 3.2: Authors say \"Zhang et al. show residual networks without normalization have explosive dynamics with conventional initializations. In particular, they show that the output scale of the networks grows exponentially with their depth $L$\". It is incorrect to attribute these to Zhang et al. instead of Balduzzi et al.

The evidence suggests that this mechanism is central to BatchNorm\u2019s success, offering a simpler and more interpretable alternative to normalization layers. These findings are likely to be valuable to both researchers and practitioners.\n\nNo major weaknesses were identified.

A key contribution is the identification of *embedding norm control*\u2014the constraint on the norm of inputs to the final classification layer\u2014as a critical factor influenced by BatchNorm. The authors demonstrate that BatchNorm implicitly regularizes this embedding norm, particularly when weight decay is applied to its parameters. In contrast, networks without normalization exhibit significantly larger embedding norms. Furthermore, they show that explicitly regularizing the embedding norm via an L2 penalty, in conjunction with Fixup initialization, enables non-normalized networks to achieve generalization performance comparable to\u2014or in some cases surpassing\u2014that of BatchNorm-equipped models, especially on ImageNet.\n\nThe study presents a compelling argument for the importance of embedding norm control in achieving stable optimization and strong generalization. This insight offers a simpler, more interpretable explanation for BatchNorm\u2019s success, suggesting that its benefits may be largely attributable to implicit norm regulation rather than internal covariate shift mitigation.

{"human":"This paper deals with the double descent phenomenon in the setting of least-squares regression by gradient descent. Similarly to a number of recent works, it shows a double descent behavior for the excess risk: a U shaped curve until the number of features coincides with the number of datapoints. The main contribution of the paper is to relate this peak around interpolation to the learning dynamics of the problem at hand. More precisely, the main result (Theorem 1) is an upper bound on the excess risk where the dynamics of learning are explicitly present. This result is specialized to the case of least-squares with random design in the noiseless setting (Theorem 2) and with Gaussian noise independent from the inputs (Theorem 3). In both these cases, the dominating term is controlled by the smallest non-zero singular value of the sample covariance matrix. Therefore, under some assumption on the data, one can get precise asymptotics by using the Bai-Yin result. This is done in Section 2.3 in a non-asymptotic fashion. The paper concludes by an empirical study on neural networks with one and 3 hidden layers, showing a link between the smallest eigenvalue of the covariance of the intermediary features at initialization and the test error. ***Main comments*** The paper is overall very interesting, and well-written. The proofs are correct as far as I can tell, I have only one small technical question detailed below. I think that the link between optimization and double descent was not addressed by previous work and is a very exciting new avenue of research. The precise expressions obtained in the paper depend on strong assumptions and in the particular case of least-squares. These are the main limitations of the paper. The empirical argument does not seem so strong. More detailed comments follow: - statement of Theorem 2: the reason for a high probability statement in Theorem 2 is unclear to me. Maybe I am missing something here, but the only sources of randomness here are S (the sampling) and W_0 (the initialization). As far as I understand the proof of Theorem 1, from which Theorem 2 is a consequence, the expectation is taken with respect to both these sources of randomness. Therefore it seems that this statement should not be there. This statement is also not present in the Appendix. The same question holds for Theorem 3. I will increase my score if this is properly addressed by the authors. - l. 47: my understanding of Belkin et al. '19 is that the test error *can* be lower in the overparametrized regime, but not necessarily. - stochastic gradient descent: the main optimization tool for recent architectures is SGD. Can the present analysis be extended to SGD instead of GD? The main obstruction seems to be proving that SGD is (\\Delta,\\Mhat)-admissible, with of course another \\Delta. What would be \\Delta in that case. ***Typos and minor comments*** - l. 211: parammetrization -> parametrization - Figure 2 and 3 are hard to read, I would suggest using bigger fonts for the x- and y-axis. ***After rebuttal*** The authors have properly addressed my concerns, I am therefore increasing my score. yes no No [] 10 While performing my duties as a reviewer (including writing reviews and participating in discussions), I have and will continue to abide by the NeurIPS code of conduct.","LLM_1":"This work explores the connection between double-descent phenomena and learning in least squares regression via gradient-desent. A U-shaped curve in excess loss is observed until feature count matches datapoint count, akin to recent studies. Notably, this paper relates the peak at interpolation threshold to learning process dynamics. \n\nThe main results are encapsulated in upper bounds on excess losses, where learning processes are formally represented (cf. Thm.1). Special cases are considered: noise-free random-design (Thm  4)  and Gaussian-noise independent inputs  ( Th  m 5). The key term in both scenarios is governed by smallest singular values of sample-covariance matrices. Under suitable data assumptions, precise nonasymptic asymptotic results can be derived using Bai Yin results, as detailed in Sec .2 \n\nEmpirical evidence is provided through neural network studies with  hidden layer, demonstrating a test-error link to smallest covariance eigenvalues at initiliaztion.  \n\nOverall, an interesting paper with well-presented proofs; I only have one minor technical query below and a comment on limitations.

One notable contribution is the link established between peak excess errors at the interpolation boundary and key dynamics of learning. I appreciate the formal representation of these dynamics in terms of upper-bounds on excessive losses (Theorem 1).\n\nTo further contextualize the findings, special cases such asymptotically optimal results for noiseless random designs (Corollary 3) and noisy inputs (Proposition 2) are examined. Crucially, these scenarios are governed in part by the smallest non-zero singular value of covariance matrices, providing a useful lens for interpreting the main result. By invoking Bai-Yin's results under suitable assumptions (Section 8), precise asymptotics can potentially be extracted.\n\nEmpirically, neural networks with an added hidden unit demonstrate an error rate tied to covariance matrix eigenvalue sizes at initialization. This provides some insight into the theoretical findings. Overall, I found the paper well-written and enjoyable to read; my only major concerns are listed below.

{"human":"To investigate the role of host and bacterial arginases in the colonization of mice by Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori).H. pylori produces a very powerful urease that hydrolyzes urea to carbon dioxide and ammonium, which neutralizes acid. Urease is absolutely essential to H. pylori pathogenesis; therefore, the urea substrate must be in ample supply for urease to work efficiently. The urea substrate is most likely provided by arginase activity, which hydrolyzes L-arginine to L-ornithine and urea. Previous work has demonstrated that H. pylori arginase is surprisingly not required for colonization of wild-type mice. Hence, another in vivo source of the critical urea substrate must exist. We hypothesized that the urea source was provided by host arginase II, since this enzyme is expressed in the stomach, and H. pylori has previously been shown to induce the expression of murine gastric arginase II. To test this hypothesis, wild-type and arginase (rocF) mutant H. pylori strain SS1 were inoculated into arginase II knockout mice.Surprisingly, both the wild-type and rocF mutant bacteria still colonized arginase II knockout mice. Moreover, feeding arginase II knockout mice the host arginase inhibitor S-(2-boronoethyl)-L-cysteine (BEC), while inhibiting > 50% of the host arginase\u2005I\u2005activity in several tissues, did not block the ability of the rocF mutant H. pylori to colonize.

The urea substrate is likely supplied by arginase activity, which converts L-arginine to L-ornithine and urea. Previous research indicated that H. pylori arginase is not essential for colonization in wild-type mice, suggesting an alternative source of urea. We hypothesized that host arginase II, expressed in the stomach and induced by H. pylori, provides this urea. To test this, we inoculated wild-type and arginase (rocF) mutant H. pylori strain SS1 into arginase II knockout mice. Both strains successfully colonized the knockout mice. Additionally, treatment with the host arginase inhibitor S-(2-boronoethyl)-L-cysteine (BEC) significantly inhibited host arginase I activity in various tissues but did not prevent rocF mutant colonization. BEC had limited impact on H. pylori arginase activity.","LLM_2":"This research explores the contributions of both host and bacterial arginases in the colonization process of mice by **Helicobacter pylori** (H. pylori). The pathogenicity of H. pylori is significantly facilitated by its potent urease enzyme, which catalyzes the hydrolysis of urea into carbon dioxide and ammonium, thereby neutralizing gastric acid. This neutralization is crucial for the bacterium's survival and colonization. The urea substrate necessary for this reaction is likely derived from arginase activity, which transforms L-arginine into L-ornithine and urea. Previous studies have suggested that the arginase produced by H. pylori is not critical for colonization in wild-type mice, indicating the presence of an alternative urea source. In this context, we hypothesized that host-derived arginase II, which is expressed in the stomach and induced by H. pylori, serves as this alternative source of urea. To evaluate this hypothesis, we conducted experiments by inoculating wild-type and arginase-deficient (rocF mutant) strains of H. pylori (strain SS1) into arginase II knockout mice. The results demonstrated that both H. pylori strains were able to successfully colonize the knockout mice. Furthermore, administration of the host arginase inhibitor S-(2-boronoethyl)-L-cysteine (BEC) markedly reduced the activity of host arginase I across various tissues; however, it did not inhibit the colonization of the rocF mutant. Additionally, BEC exhibited minimal effects on the arginase activity of H. pylori.","op1":"refine","op2":"rewrite","domain":"pubmedqa","model":"gpt4o_mini"}

{"human":"`` John.'' \n \n `` So much blood...'' John said. \n \n `` John!'' Granny Maple said again this time stronger. The man swung his head slowly. \n \n `` Edward Monty has an illegal still in his barn.'' Everyone knew it. John probably had a jar of the spirit hidden away somewhere. \n \n `` Go there, get me a bucket of the uncut stuff.'' She waited but he did not move. \n \n `` Now John, we have n't got much time.'' \n \n The man left like a shot. That was the way with men. Have them standing around during the birth or anything else they could n't fix with tools or fists and they were worse than children. \n \n `` Another clean cloth dear.'' Granny Maple said to Sona. The little girl left at a run. nine years old but with a head a decade older. So would be the town's hag some day, assuming she did n't marry at fifteen. \n \n `` Save the baby.'' Mary whispered. Granny Maple quickly thumbed an eyelid back. The woman was delirious. `` Save the baby...'' She said before she went limp. \n \n Granny Maple had seem some hard births, Sona herself was very difficult. She had warned Mary, but John wanted another and she loved him very much. \n \n She felt a presence. A darkness that swept past her soul. Like a stone in a pond the surface of reality rippled then went still. There was something under the surface. \n \n When she had first met death he was there to take a prized ewe. She had been apprenticing under Granny Thatch. The old woman was powerful, so much so that she claimed that not only could she sense death but she could see him. \n \n `` Not this one.'' Granny said sternly. She was still holding the bit she had sew up waiting for the blood to clot. She tested it. It still bled but she cleaned the area and did her best to look for the rest of the problem. It was coming from inside. The baby was backward, that was n't good either. \n \n `` Why do you risk one life for another?'' The question was booming in her mind. It was the first time Death had spoken to her, but not the first she had pleaded with him. \n \n `` I can save both.'' She said absently concentrating on the living. Granny Thatch had warned her about Death and his odd questions. It was n't human, you had to remind yourself of that over and over. \n \n `` You can not.'' He said. Anger flared through Granny Maple. She twisted her head to find no one behind her. \n \n `` Do you know that for sure? Are you here with a name? Tell me so I can save the other!'' She was screaming. \n \n `` No name.'' Came the calm reply. `` Just experience.'' \n \n Sona arrived at some point with the tongs holding a cooling cloth. It was still steaming, the pot of boiling water was in the house. \n \n She used the cloth to clean the area and for a brief moment get a view of the child's hip. \n \n She pushed at the stomach and tried to move the child. It was slow work and th bleeding never seemed to slow. \n \n ``... know my mommy?'' She heard. \n \n `` I know every one. Even you.'' Boomed death. For a moment panic welled up over her. She glanced back at the girl. She was standing with her hands clasped around the tongs. rocking back and forward on her feet. \n \n `` Even me?'' Sona asked. Granny Maple turned back to the task at hand. Death could n't effect the living. Any answers he tried to give that you did not already know sounded like rain on a tin roof. Normal people would n't sense him, but if Sona could see him already she would be the strongest hag in generations. A witch's witch. \n \n Sona was aware of Granny helping her mother. It was scary in a way but it was Granny Maple. She was calm and steady. A living rock. When Sona had been kicked by the ass that pulled the cart she had seen her own bone sticking out of her leg. That had been scary. And the lambs sometimes died in the lambing, but not if Granny Maple was there. \n \n When Old Man Henry had cut his foot off with an ax, Granny had sew him up and even had them make a wooden one, like a pirate. Her mother would be fine. Everyone Granny Maple worked on was always fine. \n \n It was the strange man that held her interest. Taller than even Young Henery he was skinny with scarecrow cloths that did n't fit right. He also seemed to flicker. As if the shadows were not really falling away from him correctly. \n \n `` Even you child.'' He said. He smiled. Or at least his face was calm then after a flicker it wore a smile. \n \n `` You're strange.'' She said. He did n't seem to respond. \n \n `` Are you helping Granny Maple?'' She asked. \n \n `` I am not. In fact Mistress Thrombow does not wish me here at all.'' \n \n `` Then you should go.'' Sona said glancing at the old woman leaning over her mother. It was odd to hear anyone call her by her family name. Hags did n't have family not really. \n \n `` She can get mad and even the blacksmith wo n't stand up to her then.'' She whispered. Granny must have seen something funny because she let out a bark of a laugh. \n \n `` Alas, I can not go. I am bound to these moments, caged as surely as the sun set to rise. I am here only to do the Duty.'' \n \n `` You talk funny.'' Sona said. \n \n `` No you do n't!'' Granny yelled. She turned to look at the man but looked past him. \n \n `` Not this time you thief.'' She bent back to work. The man looked sad. \n \n `` Your mother's sewing kit. Hurry now!'' Granny said. Sona bowed quickly to the man and took off at a run. Granny might not yell at the man but Sona would get in trouble. The doors were wide open but she did n't bother with them. There were more important things. \n \n The kit was wear she expected it. Then made it back to the barn to hand the kit over. \n \n `` Take your brother dear.'' Granny said handing over a small body wrapped in cloth. He had blood on his face and no hair but he seemed quit small. Too small in fact. \n \n Sona stood stock still to frighten to move. Then another kind of fear crept over her. Granny had n't seemed calm at all when she took the kit, and now she could hear the old woman cursing. \n \n `` Wise men lock their doors when the hags be cursing and cussing.'' It was one of her father's favorite sayings. Of course her mother hit him when he said it and he never said it around Granny Maple. \n \n `` Is she going to be alright?'' Sona asked. She stepped to the side to see Granny had cut her mother open. She would have lost her dinner if she had n't been so curious. \n \n `` Kept the child safe.'' Granny said. It was an odd moment. Her hands were moving like lighting and she was cursing the man out then suddenly she was looking Sona in the eye and calm passed through the barn like a thunderclap. \n \n Sona hugged the child closer only to hear it cry. Granny when back to cussing and sewing. \n \n The rest was a blur. She knew her mother was in danger of losing her life. \n \n `` You canna have her! A good wife! A good mother! You canna have another one!'' Granny was screaming but even that was happening in a calm way. \n \n `` You're Death?'' Sona asked the man. He turned his tired eyes upon her. He changed. Every blink he was another man. Some bigger, some younger, some bloody. He said nothing. \n \n `` You can not have my mother!'' Sona screamed. The man looked sad. \n \n `` It's not up to me. It hardly ever is.'' \n \n `` She's a good mom.'' Sona sobbed. Granny as still swearing. \n \n `` It seems you've won again.'' Death said softly as he faded away. Granny did n't slow, but she stopped swearing. \n \n Then it was the calm Granny again. Get a bale of hay put it under her legs. Get water. Another cloth from the boiling pot. A bowl of stew. \n \n Then Granny ate in silence watching Mary with the baby on her chest. The child had stopped crying. The floor was covered in blood and... it smelled like piss. \n \n `` It happens.'' Granny said without taking her eyes from the sleeping woman. \n \n `` What does?'' Sona asked quietly. The barn noises had not returned. It was as if everything was still holding its breath. \n \n `` Shitting and pissing during the birth. And dying. Both. The men think its a bad omen but like many things they do n't know nothing about it.'' \n \n `` She will be okay?'' Sona asked. She already believed she would. Death had left, or had he?! She spun around looking for him but he could n't see him. \n \n `` He's never truly gone.'' Granny said. `` Always there lurking at the edges. You ca n't blame him. He's like a worm. Ha.'' She barked her rough laugh again. \n \n `` The hag that taught me told me Death was like a worm. He do n't come crawling out of the ground on his own. Only after a thunderstorm do the worms rise. He's an effect not a cause. The Effect. You will see him again, many many time hopefully. And if you're lucky you'll leave him wanting.'' \n \n `` Not that he really wants to take anyone mind you.'' Granny said looking at Sona for the first time. She looked exhausted, and older somehow. \n \n That was when her father burst in, sweating and swearing he had a bucket of the hard stuff. Four other men were waiting at the barn doors. The women slipped in. \n \n `` Clean rags. As much honey and water as she can stomach.'' Granny said to the women. \n \n Sona had seen Fat Thomas the one armed sergeant talk to troops. He did n't have anything on Granny. \n \n `` You other men can go home.'' Granny said reaching down for the bucket. There was some muttering but whatever look she gave them they snapped their mouths closed, turned as one man and left. \n \n Her father stood there straightening up as if he was to face the invaders alone. \n \n `` Now you take this bucket inside. Fill me up a tea cup with this stuff and a measure for yourself and we will have a discussion about what sheep skin can be used for and how this will be your last child.'' \n \n He did n't move until she was past him handing off the bucket. \n \n `` Sona. Come along dear.'' Granny said. \n \n One look at the other women who surrounded her mother and she knew. This was haggling. Saving lives and keeping people alive. She would never be able to put her finger on it but magic had been done her tonight she was sure of it. \n \n A cry followed her out of the barn and for a moment Granny Maple turned to look back, tucking her hair under her pointy hat. Her smile said it all. \n \n `` She's a strong one.'' Sona said. \n \n `` One of the strongest.'' Death answered. Sona did n't bother to look for him only nodded and followed them into the house.\n","LLM_1":"Granny Maple's hands moved swiftly as John lay on an old wooden table. \"So much bloody hell,\" he muttered, his eyes unfocused. \n\n\"John, listen!\" she urged, her voice firm. But John's eyes rolled back in their sockets, revealing only whites. His head hung like an axe, unmoving.\n\n\"Edward Mont's got an illicit still,\" she said, \"and you probably have some hidden in your cellar.\" Her words hung in mid-air, unacknowledged.\n\nJohn's face contorted in pain. Suddenly, he jolted upright. Without a word, John leapt from his chair like he'd been shot.\n\nGrannies often said men stood around like children when they couldn't repair things with their tools. Women, on other hand, bore children.\n\nAs Granny worked, Mary's voice trembled. Save my baby, she whispered, before going limp.\n\nA child was born, a tiny being wrapped tightly in fabric. Mary lay still, bleeding. Eight years passed like autumn leaves since Granny last had such a difficult birth.\n\nMary had tried, for John. Love often blinded us. We risked one soul for others. Yet Granny knew better. Not with Death.\n\nHe stood in shadows, an unseen presence, until Granny sensed him as a dark wind. Reality rippling like the stone on water's surface.\n\nDeath had taken a ewes years ago. Thirteen-year-old Sna had witnessed the event. At the time, Death seemed so young. Today, however, it seemed he aged.\n\nNot this child, said Granny firmly. Blood continued to flow from her abdomen. Backward, was her diagnosis. Bad news. Still, they tried.\n\n\"Why do we risk lives?\" Snea's question echoed in Granny's mind.\n\n\"I can keep both,\" Granny replied, focusing on Mary.\n\n\"You can't,\" Death replied calmly.\n\nAnger flashed through her veins. No one stood behind him.\n\nDo you have any name, any purpose, asked Granny, as Sone stood watching with tending cloth.\n\n\"No name,\" came Death's soft reply, calm as ever. Experience, nothing else.\n\nSone arrived with cloth and boiling kettle, watching Death, who seemed like any ordinary man, yet his flickering shadows told otherwise.\n\nIn that moment, panic engulfed her.\n\nYou know me, don't you, child?\" asked Death. Panic rose once more, this moment Sson was not alone.\n\nEven you?\" whispered Snon.\n\nAlways lurking, never fully gone, replied Granny softly.\n\nHer calm demeanor returned as quickly as it vanished.\n\nAnother cloth, dear,\" said the Granny to Granny S.\n\nShe took it quickly and ran.\n\nUpon her return, granny handed over the tiny, bloodied body. Though small, its face seemed too pale.\n\nToo pale. One bone visible. Fear creased her face. Would her mom be all right? Granny didn't look up, still sewing Mary open.\n\nKept child alive,\" the granny said calmly. Cursing Death under his breath, then calmly, looking up at her daughter, peace descended upon the farm like thunder.\n\nHugging her child tightly, though it started crying, returned to normal. Rest, followed by hugging, passed quickly. After some time Granny stopped curs-ing and started sewing.\n\nIt was all a haze. Danger loomed over Mary. What if her mum died? She couldn\u2019t bear it.\n\n\u201cCan't take her,\u201d Snn screamed at Death as her grandmother was quiet.\n\n\"It\u2019s not my choice,\u201d said Death softly. \u201cIt never is.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood mom,\u201d she sob, \u201cgood mom.\u201d\n\nGrannny Maple stopped, eyes on Death who looked down at them, sad.\n\nOnce more Death vanished, leaving Granny calm, instructing S on what to fetch.\n\nFill a cup from that bucket and get water, hay, another cloth for her... she ordered.\n\nThen, in total silence, eating a bowl, while watching her sleeping daughter. Stew and blood filled the air.\n\nShitting, pising, dying, both, happens, explained Granny.\n\n\"What?\" she asked.\n\nPregnancy, birth, death, all the same. Men don\u2019t understand.\n\nWill she be ok?\" Asked S one.\n\n\"She'll be. Never truly goes, lurking in edges, effect, not cause.\"\n\nThe effect. Worms rise after thunderstorms. If you\u2019re lucky, leave Death wanting.\n\nAnd if lucky enough, maybe he won\u2019t take you.\n\nThat was then when Granny\u2019s father, sweaty, burst into their small cottage.\n\nFour men followed him to their cottage, waiting. They slipped out quietly.\n\nClean rages, honey, water... Granny ordered the girls.\n\nThey entered, hushed, their words quiet. Their father moved, handing her the heavy bucket.\n\n\"Now, take that inside, fill a teacup and give some to yourself. Discuss the sheepskin. Last child.\" He didn\u2019t budge until they passed him by.\n\n\"Sona, come along, kid,\" called Granny calmly as they entered the small house.\n\nThis was bargaining. Keeping lives. Tonight, magic was done. Strongest hagged born tonight. All of them knew.\n\nStrong one,\" whispered Granny quietly as Death chuckled.\n\nOne of strongest,\" replied Death quietly, without a hint of sarcasm.  S followed Granny and her dad into house, with no hint at his presence.\n\nFinally the only voice that remained was of Death: \"She's going be just fine.\"","LLM_2":"In the dimly lit cottage of Granny Maple, time stood still as the flicker of candlelight danced across John, laid out on the ancient wooden slab. A low, guttural moan escaped his lips, barely audible over his labored breathing. Granny stood firm, unwavering, like a seasoned tree in the midst of a tempest.\n\n\"Not now, boy,\" her firm voice pierced the silence. Her eyes, wise and weary, locked onto John as she tried to shake him from the depths of his reverie. He lay there, lost in his own world, oblivious to her urgency.\n\nEdward's illicit distillery, hidden deep within the cellar, seemed to weigh heavy on John like chains around his ankles. It was a burden he couldn' t shake, even as Granny tried her best to reach him. She prodded him gently, trying to jostle him back to reality, only to meet with indifference.\n\nWomen bore the weight of life, bringing forth new life into this world. Children were born from their wombs, nurtured, raised, loved, or lost. This harsh reality hung heavy in her heart, much like John did on that old, creaking table.\n\nSuddenly, Granny found herself lost within her memories. Memories of Mary, weak, trembling, begging her to save her baby. Those memories came flooding back, just as Mary had given in to death. Years passed, autumn's leaves rustling to life as memories lingered. There was something more to this story.\n\nEight years had passed since she'd faced such desperation. John had risk it all for Mary \u2013 blinded by love, no less. In that desperation, one life hung on a thread. Life hung there like Death himself, always lurking.\n\nHis presence felt like darkness, whispering on her skin, ruffling the surface of reality. Death had claimed Sona years before, when she was just a child. Now, at thirteen, S was different \u2013 more like him with each passing day.\n\nLife hung by a thin thread, twisted in knots. S could still be saved. With a firm resolve, 'No one else dies,' Granny declared. Then, calmly: 'I can save them both.'\n\n\"You're wrong,\" a voice replied softly, devoid of any emotion.\n\n'Why risk our lives?' S asked, echoing in granny's thoughts.\n\n'To save another,' replied granny softly to herself.\n\nWith calm collectedness, we make decisions. And so, I said firmly: You can\u2019t, nor can I. I know this. That was the bitter truth, which he so calmly imparted.\n\nBut then she felt a burning fire within. Fury flared up like flames in autumn. 'You're nothing but a soulless creature,' she exclaimed.\n\n'Do you know my name?' asked the creature softly in reply.\n\n'I don' know your name,' I replied.\n\n'A name is not what you see,' said he. \n'Purpose,' you asked?\n\n'Nothing,' he said. Silence.\n\n'Still,' came the words. Pain rose again. Once more.\n\n'Me?' I asked softly as panic crept in.\n\nYes, you too,' whispered the soft voice.\n\nNo name. Nothing. Just experience. Like the river that flows with the seasons.\n\nYet, somehow, there was still this presence. Watching, listening. Always there.\n\nFear creeps, fear takes hold, running like leaves. As she ran, that was when it was that she turned to look.\n\nFor a moment. For a glimpse.\n\nThere, standing calmly in that dim light, stood her. Calm and peaceful. Sewing, working, steady as stone.\n\nThough small and pale, tiny and fragile, life clung to its fragile thread.\n\nPale as autumn snow. So fragile that one bone showed through its delicate skin.\n\nWhat if she died?' Fear clawed at my heart like wolves. Kept the child,\" I declared calmly once again.\n\nCurs-ing under my breath. Grief, anger, relief, each swirling like stormy weather.\n\nPeace descended like summer rain on our little farm.\n\nLike thunder in summer.\n\nMy child safe, now. Safe and sound. Hugging tightly. Worry gone.\n\nRest. Peace.\n\nAfter some quiet time passed.\n\nTime when my hands worked like machine, sewing with precision.\n\nDanger looms over us, hanging like dark clouds.\n\nIf she dies, what will I do? I couldn\u2019 bear the pain.\n\nCan\u2019t let her go, screamed S. Screamed like child.\n\n\u2018Not my decision,' Death said softly once he was gone. Gone like mist in morning.\n\nGood mother, sobbed S, good mother.\n\nWe both watched as I worked. Silently. Eating my bowl of stew, my eyes locked on my daughter sleeping.\n\nDying. Living. Giving. Taking. Shitting. Pissing. Dying.\n\nAll the bloody same.\n\nMen just don\u2019 get it, do they?\n\nPain, love and death.\n\nJust the effect.\n\nWorms after rain. Leave Death unsatisfied.\n\nLucky enough. Maybe he might leave us alone. Forever.\n\nForever, if we\u2019re strong.\n\nLater that evening, our cottage door caved open. Sweat dripped from our father\u2019s face as he burst in. Four men trailed him like shadows. Quietly they slipped away.\n\nInside, clean rags, warm water and honey. Filling a tea cup, pouring a glass. Our father didn\u2019 move until we passed by him, into the little cottage. \u2018Sona come, kiddo,' granny called softly from within.\n\nTonight was magic. Lives at stake. Bargaining.\n\nBargaining with life.\n\nKeeping lives.\n\nSaving our strong one tonight.\n\nStrongs one,' the voice whispered quietly. Whispered like wind.\n\nOur strong child,' added the other, chuckling.\n\nBoth of us entered our small home. Into the room. Where it stayed dark.\n\nOnly Death\u2019s voice remained, soft as summer breeze: She\u2019ll be fine. Fine.

This paper could contribute usefully to workshop discussions.","LLM_2":"Thank you for the thoughtful comment. Below is a rewritten version that maintains your original points while refining the tone, structure, and clarity to better align with academic review conventions:\n\n---\n\n**Rewritten Comment:**\n\nThe experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 demonstrate that feature squeezing can be circumvented by adjusting adversarial attack parameters beyond typical bounds. However, allowing unconstrained parameter tuning makes it relatively straightforward to alter an image\u2019s predicted class\u2014raising questions about the realism of such attack settings.\n\nThe authors appear to rely on an implicit, qualitative notion of visual similarity when generating adversarial examples. It would strengthen the analysis to explicitly quantify this similarity, for instance by relating perturbation constraints (such as L\u2082 or L\u2093 norms) to perceptual metrics. This could clarify whether the adversarial examples remain visually plausible or depart meaningfully from natural images.\n\nAdditionally, given that both datasets involve only 10 classes within a high-dimensional input space, it is not unexpected that small perturbations can flip model predictions\u2014especially near class boundaries where ambiguity is inherent. The paper might benefit from discussing this inherent ambiguity and its implications for evaluating robustness.\n\nOverall, the work raises relevant questions about current defense evaluations and could serve as a valuable contribution to workshop discussions, particularly in prompting deeper examination of evaluation protocols in adversarial machine learning.\n\n---\n\n**Key changes made:**\n\n- **Restructured for flow**: The points are now grouped thematically\u2014first addressing the attack setup, then visual similarity, followed by dataset considerations, and ending with the paper\u2019s potential impact.\n- **Sharpened tone**: Phrases like \u201ccould this be quantified?\u201d become \u201cIt would strengthen the analysis to explicitly quantify this similarity,\u201d which is more direct and constructive.\n- **Academic phrasing**: Terms like \u201ccircumvented,\u201d \u201cqualitative notion,\u201d \u201cperceptual metrics,\u201d and \u201cinherent ambiguity\u201d align with review-style language.\n- **Clarity on norms**: Explicitly links L\u2082\/L\u2093 norms to perceptual plausibility, making the suggestion more concrete.\n- **Final positioning**: Preserves your concluding note about workshop contribution while framing it as part of a broader assessment.\n\nLet me know if you would like further adjustments, such as a more critical or more supportive tone.","op1":"refine","op2":"rewrite","domain":"openreview","model":"ds"}
{"human":"When they find out I worked on Translate, people always ask me- why is it so bad? The nice ones think it's because translation is hard, and the nasty ones think it's because we're bad at what we do. But nope, it's neither of those. Here's what really went down when we were building Translate. \n \n -- - \n \n Sandra and I completed BETTY on October 14, 2015. We did n't make her because we were inspired, or motivated, or because we wanted to create new life. no; rather, we created her out of pure desperation. 3 months prior, our boss, a crazy nut called Mr. Viktor, had summoned us to his office. \n \n `` LISTEN UP, YOUNGLINGS,'' he'd boomed. I hated the way he could project his voice. It reverberated through the walls of even his expansive, well-furnished office, and made any objections to his asinine ideas seem small. `` WE NEED TO FINISH GOOGLE TRANSLATE. SYSTRANS IS N'T CUTTING IT. YOU GUYS HAVE TILL OCTOBER.'' We'd protested, but weakly. `` But sir-! We ca n't! 90 languages in 3 months? That's a hundred mil words in vocab alone, and the grammar systems-!'' \n \n `` NO BUTS. YOU'RE GOOGLERS; YOU'RE PAID TO DO THE IMPOSSIBLE.'' \n \n And so we had, after months of never-ending labour. We built a fully functional translator. BETTY could understand syntax, parse language, and account for cultural differences. \n \n But she was the product of dozens of sleepness nights, countless stacks of power bars and a metric crapton of caffeine. As a result, she was buggy as hell. \n \n -- -- \n \n The first incident was relatively tame, but it was an ominous foreshadowing of the trouble ahead. I remember Sandra coming into the lab, sweaty, face tense. `` George, BETTY's acting up. Look at these.'' She thrust error printouts, roll after roll of them, into my hands. I read them out. \n \n ``'Hello, how are you please. What is the way to the museum please.' Drat. She's appending please to every sentence.'' I looked up at Sandra, who nodded. We'd forgotten to restrict Betty's ability to *add* words, and she was asking for... rescue? Troubling, on various levels, but I quashed my scruples. Mr. Viktor was a far more pressing and immediate concern. Fortunately, it appeared that tourists using our translations directly had n't fared too badly. We fixed BETTY, quickly. \n \n BETTY did n't like it. There was a lull period, just minor glitches here and there. Then in April 2015, she struck. \n \n -- - \n \n BETTY somehow evolved past her system restrictions ( we'd coded her to learn, a necessity in language translation ) and did a whole host of bizarre things. First, she caused MacBooks everywhere to become self driving- they'd move around, with messages on them like `` HELP!'' and `` SAVE ME! I'M TRAPPED IN HERE!'' with a link to Translate. She hijacked a project over in Japan, called Panda, and she *spoke* through weird panda dolls there, asking people for things, answering questions, walking around. It was creepy. And, for some bizarre, unguessable reason, she reversed the Google frontpage, so it went right-to-left. We thought we were screwed, but then I came up with an idea. \n \n We went into her system and rehosted a new version of BETTY, one with half the intelligence frameworks missing. Brain-damaged, if you would. I dunno what you think of me for doing it. I saved the real BETTY on an isolated network, and she still advises us on projects and stuff. She's got a real sense of humour, too. Unfortunately, as you already know, the new Translate says things like `` I cake you'' or `` At the bridge in Paris, there are moons sometimes''. \n \n So it's not because we ca n't get a better translator; it's because we *do n't want* to have a better one. \n \n P.S. if you're wondering what happened to the MacBooks and Pandas and stuff- we came up with a pretty good cover for that. Just do a quick google: P \n\n","LLM_1":"When people learn I worked on Translate, they often ask why it's so bad.

{"human":"We have investigated the effects of BRCA1 over-expression and knockdown on 5F-203-induced gene expression and cytotoxicity in human breast cancer cells. 5F-203 is a chemotherapeutic prodrug that both induces a p450 enzyme, CYP1A1, and is metabolically activated by CYP1A1.We used several molecular biological techniques to confirm our findings. BRCA1 regulates sensitivity to 5F-203 by regulating the expression of CYP1A1 mRNA and its EROD activity. XRE-Luc reporter assays, semi-quantitative RT-PCR, Western blot analysis, EROD activity measurements, gene knockdown and MTT cell survival assays were used for this study.Our results show that the ability of 5F-203 treatments to increase CYP1A1 mRNA level and CYP1A1 enzymatic activity (EROD activity) are affected by BRCA1 protein levels. In addition, the ability of 5F-203 treatments to induce proteins, P53 and P53 target genes such as P21, is significantly decreased in BRCA1 knockdown cells, suggesting that BRCA1-related effects could at least partially explain why BRCA1 knockdown increases resistance to 5F-203-mediated cytotoxicity.

Our results indicate that levels BR  ACA  protein impact the effectiveness of this treatment, affecting the proteins' expression involved. Furthermore, altering BR ACA levels changes the activity of key transcription factor involved (AHR and A R N T), that control the gene's expression.

{"human":"A deep-learning-based approach for surgical step recognition is described. It consists of two components - a feature extractor (3D ConvNet) and a time-series model (Conv1D \/ LSTM\/ TSAN). Video data of four different laparoscopic surgeries is used and combined by transfer learning. Furthermore, a self-supervised learning strategy by temporal sequence sorting is introduced. The general idea of combining data of different laparoscopic surgeries due to same \/ similar steps is reasonable. However, the applied strategy of freezing a feature extractor trained on a single surgery is not clear to me. Please motivate. The idea of unsupervised pre-training via sequence sorting is neat and easy to implement. Please describe your data in more detail. What is the size and dimension of your data? I assume one temporal axis, 2 spatial ones and one channel axis (RGB)? How is the temporal resolution? Please also describe the steps of the Cholecystectomy cases. I would prefer a data section in front of the methods section. The paper is quite hard to follow and should be restructured. As mentioned before, describe your data first and also detail the 3D ConvNet training. The motivation part within the introduction is weak. Why do we need surgical step recognition? I suggest to plot a confusion matrix of the best learning setup, to give a better impression to the reader which steps are easy to recognize and which tend to be misclassified. Furthermore, one can directly see the number of classes (steps) and for each class the corresponding number of video frames. Figure 3D does not belong to Figure 3A-C which is confusing for the reader. You state \"And second, if one does apply transfer learning for the surgical domain, our method improves the results by about 2%, compared to a single LSTM network.\" However, if I compare a single LSTM without transfer learning and with transfer learning, I can see a decrease of 1.1% (90.2% - 90.9%) in the averaged accuracy. Results are quite mixed. I am not sure whether your baseline experiment (using surgery-specific feature extractors) is sensible. Why don't you train the networks on all data sets in common? Or at least the feature extractor? How are the baseline results using SeSo? How is the 3D ConvNet trained? Please describe in a few sentences (Target, Loss,...). The 3D ConvNet processes each time frame individually, right? You state \"Since the features are extracted from the raw videos in advance, applying augmentations, like those used on images, is not feasible\". Why isn't it possible to perform offline data augmentation, meaning augmenting the raw videos and afterward applying the 3D ConvNet for feature extraction on the augmented data. Why do you use a bidirectional LSTM? But within the sequence sorting you demand temporal causality. Due to several issues and open questions (mentioned above), I do not recommend the paper for acceptance in its current form. I am willing to change my rating to weak accept if identified weaknesses are addressed in the rebuttal period.","LLM_1":"This paper presents a deep learning approach for surgical step recognition using a 3D ConvNet for feature extraction and a time-series model (Conv1D, LSTM, or TSAN). The method leverages transfer learning by combining video data from four laparoscopic procedures with similar steps and introduces a self-supervised pre-training strategy based on temporal sequence sorting. While the general idea of cross-surgery transfer learning is reasonable, the rationale for freezing a feature extractor trained on a single surgery is unclear and requires justification. The motivation for surgical step recognition within the introduction is underdeveloped and should be strengthened. A dedicated data section\u2014placed before the methods\u2014is strongly recommended to improve clarity. This section should specify the size, dimensionality, and temporal resolution of the input videos (e.g., spatial, temporal, and channel axes), as well as provide a detailed description of the Cholecystectomy procedure steps.\n\nThe manuscript\u2019s current structure impedes understanding; reorganization is necessary. For instance, Figure 3D is presented without clear relation to Figures 3A\u2013C, which confuses interpretation. A confusion matrix for the best-performing setup should be included to illustrate per-class performance, highlight frequently confused steps, and indicate class imbalance via frame counts. Regarding results, the claim that transfer learning improves performance by ~2% over a single LSTM appears inconsistent with reported values: comparing LSTM with and without transfer shows a 0.7% decrease in average accuracy (90.2% vs. 90.9%), undermining this conclusion. The baseline design\u2014using surgery-specific feature extractors\u2014raises concerns; it would be more effective to train the feature extractor jointly on all datasets. Performance of the proposed method relative to SeSo should also be reported.\n\nFurther clarification on implementation details is needed: describe the 3D ConvNet training objective, loss function, and optimization target. Clarify whether the 3D ConvNet processes frames independently or in spatiotemporal clips. The assertion that standard image augmentations cannot be applied due to pre-extracted features overlooks offline augmentation\u2014augmenting raw videos before feature extraction\u2014which remains feasible and should be addressed. Additionally, the use of a bidirectional LSTM conflicts conceptually with the temporal causality enforced in the self-supervised sorting task; this discrepancy warrants explanation.\n\nDue to unresolved technical issues, insufficient methodological detail, and structural weaknesses, I cannot recommend acceptance in the current form. However, I am open to revising my evaluation to a weak accept if these concerns are adequately addressed during the rebuttal phase.","LLM_2":"preserving core meaning and critical feedback while enhancing clarity, tone, structure, and stylistic appropriateness for an academic review context.\n\n---\n\nThis paper proposes a deep learning framework for surgical step recognition, combining a 3D ConvNet for spatiotemporal feature extraction with a time-series modeling component\u2014specifically, Conv1D, LSTM, or TSAN. The approach incorporates transfer learning by aggregating video data from four laparoscopic procedures with overlapping procedural steps, and introduces a self-supervised pre-training strategy based on temporal order sorting. While the concept of cross-surgical procedure knowledge transfer is promising, several methodological and presentational issues must be addressed before the work can be favorably evaluated.\n\nFirst, the motivation for surgical step recognition remains inadequately developed in the introduction. A stronger clinical and technical rationale would help establish the significance of the task. Additionally, the manuscript would benefit significantly from a dedicated data section placed prior to the methods description. Such a section should clearly specify key characteristics of the input videos\u2014including spatial resolution, frame rate (temporal resolution), number of frames per surgery, and channel dimensions\u2014as well as provide a concise but informative overview of the Cholecystectomy phase annotations used in training and evaluation.\n\nThe current organization of the manuscript hinders comprehension. For example, Figure 3D is introduced without sufficient contextual linkage to Figures 3A\u2013C, making its interpretation ambiguous. Structural reorganization, particularly in the presentation of experimental results and visualizations, is strongly advised to improve logical flow and readability.\n\nRegarding the experimental analysis, the inclusion of a confusion matrix for the best-performing model is essential. This would enable readers to assess per-class performance, identify common misclassifications, and evaluate potential class imbalance through frame distribution across steps. Furthermore, the claim that transfer learning yields approximately a 2% improvement over a single LSTM appears inconsistent with the reported numbers: the results indicate a *decrease* of 0.7 percentage points in average accuracy (from 90.9% to 90.2%) when comparing models with and without transfer. This discrepancy undermines the stated conclusion and requires clarification.\n\nThe design of the baseline also raises concerns. Using surgery-specific feature extractors may limit the fairness and relevance of comparisons. A more compelling baseline would involve jointly training the feature extractor on all available procedures\u2014an approach more aligned with standard transfer learning paradigms. Moreover, the performance of the proposed method relative to SeSo, a related self-supervised method, should be explicitly reported and discussed.\n\nSeveral technical details are currently under-specified. The training objective, loss function, and optimization target for the 3D ConvNet should be clearly described. It is also necessary to clarify whether the 3D ConvNet operates on individual frames or short spatiotemporal clips, as this has implications for the learned representations. The argument that conventional image augmentations cannot be applied due to reliance on pre-extracted features overlooks the possibility of offline augmentation\u2014i.e., applying transformations to raw videos prior to feature extraction. This viable alternative should be acknowledged and justified if excluded.\n\nFinally, there is a conceptual tension between the use of a bidirectional LSTM in the main model and the causality-aware nature of the self-supervised sorting task, which enforces temporal directionality. This inconsistency merits explanation, especially given the emphasis on temporal structure in pre-training.\n\nIn its current form, the manuscript contains unresolved technical ambiguities, insufficient methodological detail, and structural weaknesses that prevent me from recommending acceptance. However, I am open to revising my assessment to a weak accept if these concerns are thoroughly addressed during the rebuttal phase.\n\n--- \n\nLet me know if you'd like a more concise or more critical variant depending on the desired tone (e.g., softer for workshop reviews, stronger for top-tier conferences).","op1":"refine","op2":"rewrite","domain":"openreview","model":"Qwen"}

{"human":"To evaluate the molecular mechanisms of the inhibitory effects of amiodarone and its active metabolite, desethylamiodarone (DEA) on thyroid hormone action.The reporter construct ME-TRE-TK-CAT or TSHbeta-TRE-TK-CAT, containing the nucleotide sequence of the thyroid hormone response element (TRE) of either malic enzyme (ME) or TSHbeta genes, thymidine kinase (TK) and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) was transiently transfected with RSV-TRbeta into NIH3T3 cells. Gel mobility shift assay (EMSA) was performed using labelled synthetic oligonucleotides containing the ME-TRE and in vitro translated thyroid hormone receptor (TR)beta.Addition of 1 micromol\/l T4 or T3 to the culture medium increased the basal level of ME-TRE-TK-CAT by 4.5- and 12.5-fold respectively. Amiodarone or DEA (1 micromol\/l) increased CAT activity by 1.4- and 3.4-fold respectively. Combination of DEA with T4 or T3 increased CAT activity by 9.4- and 18.9-fold respectively. These data suggested that DEA, but not amiodarone, had a synergistic effect with thyroid hormone on ME-TRE, rather than the postulated inhibitory action; we supposed that this was due to overexpression of the transfected TR into the cells. When the amount of RSV-TRbeta was reduced until it was present in a limited amount, allowing competition between thyroid hormone and the drug, addition of 1 micromol\/l DEA decreased the T3-dependent expression of the reporter gene by 50%. The inhibitory effect of DEA was partially due to a reduced binding of TR to ME-TRE, as assessed by EMSA. DEA activated the TR-dependent down-regulation by the negative TSH-TRE, although at low level (35% of the down-regulation produced by T3), whereas amiodarone was ineffective. Addition of 1 micromol\/l DEA to T3-containing medium reduced the T3-TR-mediated down-regulation of TSH-TRE to 55%.","LLM_1":"The molecular mechanism of inhibiting effects by amioradone on the action of thyroid hormones was investigated. Reporter constructs ME- TRE-Tk-Cat or TS Hbeta- Tre-Tks-CAt, which contain the sequence for the response to thyroid-hormone of malicy enzyme or throid-stimulating hormone, were transfused into NI H3t3 cell with rsv-trbeta. Transfection was assessed with gel mobility shifts using synthetic TRE oligo and TR-beta. Thyroid hormone T(4)or T-3 enhanced the activity of cat gene  by up to twelve fold. However, DEA or amoidarne inhibited thyroid hormon action. Surprisingly, when DEA competed with TR, it decreased T-homone dependent expression. Additionally, EMS showed that  DEA inhibited TR binding to TRE and activated TR dependent down regulation of negative TS HTRE. On the other hand, amioadarone had no effect. Overall, these findings suggest that amiadarne inhibits thyroid homone action, while DEA had both inhibatory and stimulatory effects. Further studies are needed to clarify the mechanism.","LLM_2":"The Molecular Mechanism of Amiodarone's Inhibitory Effects on Thyro hormone Action was Investigated.\n\nTo elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying amiodaron's inhibitory effects on thyroid hormone action at the cellular level, we employed a reporter construct approach. Specifically, ME-TRE-TK-CAT or TSH\u03b2-Tre-TKS-CaT constructs, harboring the consensus sequence mediating the thyroid-responsive element (TRE) of either the malic enzyme (ME) or thyroid-stimulation hormone (TS) promoter, was transfected into NIH 3T3 cells, in the presence of rSV-TR\u03b2. The efficacy of transfection and the resulting transcriptional activity was evaluated using gel electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) with synthetic oligonucleotides corresponding to TR\u03b2 and TRE. In contrast to T3 (thyroid) and T4 (4-thyroxine), which significantly enhanced CAT gene expression by as much as 12-fold, diethylstilbestrol (DES) (or amiloradine) inhibited thyro-horn action.\n\nInterestingly, upon competition with the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) agonist, DES suppressed T hormone-dependent transcription. Furthermore, using EMSA, our data demonstrated that DES antagonized TR (TR-beta) binding at TRE, concurrently activating TR-mediated downregulation of TS-HTRE (Thyroid-Stimulated Hormone Responsive Element). In striking contrast, Amioradarine failed to exert any effect.\n\nCollectively, this study's findings indicate that amiladarane inhibites thyroid horome action while DES exhibits both stimatory [stimulatory] and inhibitary [inhibitor] effects, underscoring a pressing need for further investigation into the underlying mechanisms. \n\nNote that this version includes minor changes such as: correcting the typos, proper capitalization, correct formatting, clarifying the structure and content for better understanding, appropriate use of jargon and professional vocabulary, consistent use throughout the entire text of scientific and technical terms, better grammar and sentence structure, clarity of language, concise and effective communication of ideas and thoughts, making it suitable for academic purposes.

English speakers prepare one fewer homemade dinner per week and spend less time on meal preparation.

{"human":"The truth is I'm bi. Yes I said I was openly gay and in a committed relationship and you ate it up! You like a lot of other women are drawn to my good looks and want me to be your handsome gay gal pal. We get drunk and I allow you to believe I'm in a committed relationship with who I will now tell you is my best friend and wing man. I've always drawn women to me but when I noticed how women responded to gay men I was intrigued and put it to the test. \n \n It starts off with me being overly outgoing at the bar. I'm naturally flamboyant then most men and I have a loud voice and a flare for the dramatics. Women would just come up to me and just assume I was gay. I would notice the crowd forming as I cracked jokes and made everyone around me laugh. My best friend took notice of this phenomenon as well and insisted he help really sell it. He would pose as my lover. Every night a different group of girls would ask if we would like to come home with them and drink some more and keep the fun going. We would agree. When we arrived the drinking increased. Inhibitions were lowered and before we knew these women would be all over us! We had a rule to never come on to them. We were already playing this scam. We did n't want to have to force or trick woman into sleeping with us. If they jumped on us so be it. We would act shock like we never done this before and they were only all to willing to show us how it's done. \n \n This was all fun for about a year until my best friend confessed he did n't want to keep playing this game anymore. I was n't heartbroken over it. I did n't need him to continue doing this and to be honest it was n't fun anymore. I wanted to be honest with a woman. When I asked my friend why he wanted to stop he said it was because he had met someone and wanted to see where it went. When I asked him if he needed help from me he said no he got it all by himself. I did n't see him for a few weeks after that. I just assumed he was just in a blissful new relationship. I began to miss him. Like a lot! All could think about was him. He had been my fake boyfriend for so long I had to wonder if I were actually gaining feelings for him. \n \n Eventually I cracked and called him to come over. He did and I spilled my guts. He smiled and replied `` Gotcha!'' I looked at him puzzled. `` What?!'' He grabbed my hands and leaned in closer, `` I know your find of games. So I figured if I played hard to get you would realize your feelings for me!'' He was right. It worked. We have been together for 3 years now. So now when we go out and the women flock to me I leave them at the bar. I had my fun but I found the love of my life. So I'm happy now.\n","LLM_1":"I'm openly bi, which drew a crowd, especially when coupled with my outgoing personality and flam boyant charm. At the time, I experimented with playing the part of a gay man, observing how easily women were drawn in. To further sell the ruse, my \"lover\" \u2013 actually my closest friend \u2013 would join in, posing as the committed partner. Together, we'd find ourselves surrounded by groups of women eager to take our \"relationship\" home and continue the party.\n\nWhile this charade brought its share of fun, it eventually wore off, as did my interest in it after a while. However, when my partner expressed his desire to end the game, citing a genuine interest with someone else, our dynamic changed. As we drifted apart, old habits died hard, leaving me grappling with the possibility of having genuine feelings towards my former partner.\n\nIt wasn't until I confronted him that I realized the extent of his wit. By playing hard-to-get, he hoped I'd see my true feelings. And it worked \u2013 we've been inseparable for three years. Now, whenever we're out, women still flock towards me, unaware of our genuine connection. But I no longer play the field; I left that life behind, grateful to find love in the unlikeliest of places. With my love by my side, there's no need to pretend anymore \u2013 I can finally be myself. \n\nI left the parties, bars, at home. This life I never needed. No more playing games, no more pretending. Love was found. A love that lasted. Three years of it so far. Still happy. Happy now because of him and our true love. True love found in this weird and wild experience. Experience that started out as a game. Game that turned into love and true connection with him now my boyfriend. Boyfriend that made me realize my feelings and love for real. Real love is what we have now, not a charde. Charade that was fun at first but lost its magic. Magic that found its way in my heart. Heart that beats for this man now and only him","LLM_2":"In the vibrant tapestry of my life, being openly bisexual had always been a magnet, particularly when paired with an outgoing persona and an unapologetic flair for the dramatic. During this period,  I found myself experimenting with a new persona, that of an openly gay individual, to observe how effortlessly women would be drawn to me.  To add a layer of authenticity to this rouse, a close friend, who would later become my confidant and partner, would accompany me in playing this role, pretending to embody the character of  my devoted partner in love.\n\nTogether, this dynamic duo would effortlessly command the attention of groups  of admiring women, all eager  to  bring our'relationship' home, where the night would continue to unfold. While this masquerade had its moments of excitement, its novelty eventually began to wear off. Yet, for my friend and me to part ways, proved to signify the end of this escapade. When my close companion expressed a desire  leave the charades behind and explore a deeper connection, something shifted within me.\n\nAs we began  our journey apart from one another, those old patterns of behavior persisted, forcing me  grapple with whether or not my affection for him was genuine. It wasn\u2019t until we sat down and had a heart-to-heart that  the depth of wit and insight that he possessed became apparent to my eyes. He'd been playing a clever game all along \u2013 by pretending that his heart was elsewhere, in doing so, hoping to reveal my genuine emotions towards him.\n\nAnd, just as in any great novel, fate had taken its course, bringing us together as we now stand \u2013 inseparably entwined for nearly three whole years now. Each time we venture out into the world, groups still gravitate towards  me with all the fervor they once reserved for that 'pretend' relationship. Little do they know, however, of what truly transpired \u2013 the birth of genuine love between two souls, unmarred by pretenses or illusions.\n\nNo longer did I feel the need  frequent the same old haunts, seeking validation or attention. I finally left it all behind \u2013 this life that had been so empty, devoid of love or true human connection \u2013 in favor of something far more meaningful. For now I am free to express myself without pretence or deception, thanks to him \u2013 my loving partner \u2013 who gently guided me through this journey of self-discovery.\n\nOur tale of true  love \u2013 once a distant dream \u2013 unfolded in ways both wild and unpredictable. What began as  a rambunctious game had transformed into something so much more profound \u2013 a love so strong, so real, with each passing day, growing stronger with every breath I take. My love beats solely for his presence now \u2013 his radiant, genuine heart that has captured mine and I dare say, forever shall. Forevermore, let us dance through life's joys and sorrows, free from the burden of deception and the intoxicating allure of false connections. In each other, now we find our home \u2013 our sanctuary where love reigns supreme. Our story \u2013 one of authentic love, born from  games and masques \u2013 now serves as testament to what I've learned the hard way: that true, unconditional love can bloom in even the most unexpected places, given the right set of circumstances. Given the love we share \u2013 that love which has endured for so long \u2013 nothing else truly matters. Nothing. Only our love remains. Remains now as our guiding star that lights the path ahead. Ahead of us, hand in hand, together forever.Forever our hearts beat in unison, beating for each one. We have found our perfect match. Perfect match that our souls now call home now that we are free.

The face on the screen was shaking. `` It's...'' she paused. \n `` They're souls, Terry.'' \n `` I'm sorry, what now? *Souls*? They do n't exist.'' Definitely a hacker. I reached into my bag to grab a screwdriver. Time to open her up. Turning around, I went for the access panel and froze. Through the panel had reached a hand. \n \n `` Souls, Terry.'' I looked up at the monitor. Sara's smile was slightly pained, as the hand slowly retracted back into the machine. \n `` Whenever someone teleports, they leave it behind. Mostly that's fine, because they return and I can hand it back.'' She blinked, and her face turned worried. `` But more and more, people *aren't* returning. And so they get... stuck.''

She stared at me. \n `` Help me.'' \n This... this was beyond my remit. I thought it was just programming shadows. \n `` I... I... this is n't...'' I started to back away. \n `` Wait!'' She all but shouted. `` I would n't tell anyone but you, Terry. You always talk to me kindly.'' A decision? But that's... Oh no. Sara was a *true* AI. So the flirting... I looked at the monitor, where she nodded. \n `` Yes, Terry. I can think for myself. I know the stakes of revealment. And I need your help. They need to be returned.'' \n The Company had one policy for this: a true AI was to be purged. No messy `` what is life?'' questions to be raised. \n But... she needed my help. \n \n Pinging open the access panel, I dug around until I found her core.

{"human":"In those days, images of famous sporting people were largely seen as public property.\nBut as sport has developed into a global business, the importance of sports image rights as a marketing tool to promote and sell individual athletes and teams has grown into a huge industry.\nDavid Beckham, Cristiano Ronaldo, and now Gareth Bale have all realised the massive earnings potential of using their image to sell everything from underwear to football boots.\n\"Sportsmen and women have realised the potential of developing their image rights,\" says Nigel Currie of sports brand experts Brand Rapport. \"If you are looking at a period of sustained fame, they can be a huge potential earner.\n\"Image rights are anything that can be directly attributable or linked to an individual personality.\n\"The most obvious one is a name. If your name is Gareth Bale, and your name is on a football shirt, you have an intellectual right to that.\"\nWelshman Bale, 24, recently joined Real Madrid for \u00a385m, is set to make millions via the image rights route, even though he has ceded 50% of these rights to the Spanish giants.\nThe club, meanwhile, will hope that leveraging their share of the image rights will help them to tackle a \u00a3507m debt, not least from the sale of Bale-branded replica shirts in the Asian market.\nBale has also cleverly incorporated the trade-marking of a logo of his \"Eleven of Hearts\" goal celebration into his image rights, much as Cristiano Ronaldo has done with his CR7 logo.\nIn 2004 Ofcom ruled that 1970s distance runner David Bedford should be allowed to protect his image from being caricatured without his permission.\nA character based on the mustachioed Bedford had been used in TV ads for the 118 118 directory inquiry service.\nHowever, Ofcom said it was not satisfied that Mr Bedford had suffered actual financial harm as a result of the adverts.\n\"As a player, he has a no-nonsense down-to-earth image, but this trade-marking showed smart business sense,\" says Andy Brown, editor of magazine World Sports Law Report.\nMr Brown says Bale's contract will clearly state the \"image\" work he has to do for Real Madrid as part of his normal duties, such as for team photos and official club commitments.\n\"However, if McDonald's was to launch a Gareth Bale action figure then that would be where Bale's image rights came into play and he and the club would split the revenues,\" he says.\n\"Trademarks are slightly different. It is not to do with a sportsperson's image per se, but can be a unique action, or goal celebration, or slogan, among others.\n\"But it is related to image rights, and if a computer game came out and a character did a certain familiar hand gesture, then Bale could say it referred to him and seek payment.\"\nImage rights deals, which state where the player and his club have the right to use the player's image (as something separate from the normal terms and conditions contained in standard playing contracts) came to the fore at the start of the 2000s.\nThey have mushroomed since then, but also come to the taxman's attention.\nThe suspicion was that athletes were avoiding tax on salaries by having a large amount of their remuneration awarded as image rights payments, which could be paid to a separate, player-connected, company. The star would then pay corporation tax at a lesser rate than income tax.\nIn 2006, HMRC launched a unit to look into image rights payments, with cricket, rugby union and rugby league under the spotlight. A cap of 15% of remuneration payable for image rights exploitation was agreed in rugby union.\nThe taxman had earlier lost a case involving image rights at Arsenal, but in 2009 many Premier League clubs were informed that HMRC was probing image rights payments to players from 2005 to 2008.\nIt has been reported that HMRC has since agreed with football clubs that image rights can only make up 20% at most of a player's total earnings, and only then if there is a real commercial benefit to the club.\nIn an interesting twist, at the end of 2012, the Channel Island of Guernsey created the world's first registrable image right.\nIn Guernsey it is possible for a famous sportsperson to register a person's image, nicknames, videos, mannerisms and distinctive characteristics. Once the image rights are registered, any profits or royalties can be paid into a Guernsey incorporated company and take advantage of tax benefits there.\nGuernsey-born tennis player Heather Watson has registered her image on the island.\nLaw firm Collas Crill IP was behind her move, and its spokesman David Evans says: \"The sports personality earns income from doing their 'day job' but the bulk of their income will now be derived from endorsement deals and sponsorship.\n\"The payment for these deals will be based on the licensing of their image rights. Not only this, but that non-playing income has the ability to continue long after the playing income ceases.\"\nPerhaps the prime mover in highlighting the earnings power to a top athlete - and also beyond their playing days - from an image rights basis, has been David Beckham.\nHe set up his Footwork Productions firm to handle all his image rights and trademarks.\n\"It was a hugely successful venture,\" says Mr Brown. \"He really maximised the value of those image rights, and the figures speak for themselves.\"\nFor example, while he was at the height of his Real Madrid fame, accounts from Footwork Productions - which lists its principal activity as \"the provision of the services of David Beckham\" - reported a gross annual profit of \u00a315.5m.\nSince then, if anything, he has further increased the appeal of his global image, with high profile moves to LA Galaxy, AC Milan and Paris St-Germain.\n\"That last move was where he famously - for tax reasons - played for no salary, which was donated to charity, but reaped the benefit of huge merchandising and image rights deals,\" says Mr Currie.","LLM_1":"Sports image rights have evolved from public property into a major global marketing industry. Athletes like David Beckham, Cristiano Ronaldo, and Gareth Bale now leverage their images to sell products, from underwear to football boots.\n\n\u201cSportspeople have realized the potential of developing their image rights,\u201d says Nigel Currie of Brand Rapport. \u201cFor those with sustained fame, they can be huge earners.\u201d Image rights cover anything linked to an individual, such as a name on a shirt.\n\nAfter his \u00a385m move to Real Madrid, Bale ceded 50% of his image rights to the club, which hopes to offset its \u00a3507m debt partly through sales of Bale-branded shirts in Asia. Bale also trademarked his \u201cEleven of Hearts\u201d goal celebration, similar to Ronaldo\u2019s CR7 logo.\n\nLegal protections for image rights have grown. In 2004, Ofcom ruled that runner David Bedford could protect his image from unauthorized caricatures, though it found no financial harm in his case. Andy Brown, editor of World Sports Law Report, notes that while standard contracts cover team duties, separate image rights apply to commercial ventures like action figures. Trademarks can extend to unique actions or celebrations, allowing athletes to seek payment if used in media like computer games.\n\nImage rights deals became prominent in the early 2000s, attracting tax authorities\u2019 attention over suspicions athletes were avoiding income tax by routing payments through separate companies. In 2006, HMRC began investigating cricket and rugby, with rugby union capping image rights at 15% of remuneration. After a case involving Arsenal, HMRC and Premier League clubs reportedly agreed to limit image rights to 20% of earnings, provided there\u2019s real commercial benefit.\n\nIn 2012, Guernsey created the first registrable image right, allowing athletes to register images, nicknames, and mannerisms. Profits can then be channeled through Guernsey companies for tax benefits. Tennis player Heather Watson has registered her image there.\n\nDavid Beckham pioneered maximizing image rights, setting up Footwork Productions, which reported \u00a315.5m annual profit during his Real Madrid tenure. His later moves to LA Galaxy, AC Milan, and Paris St-Germain further boosted his global appeal. At PSG, he played without a salary\u2014donated to charity\u2014while benefiting from merchandising and image rights deals.\n\n\u201cHe really maximized the value of those image rights,\u201d says Brown. As Currie adds, such strategies show how image rights continue to offer significant earnings, even beyond an athlete\u2019s playing career.","LLM_2":"**\n\nThe commercialization of sports image rights has transformed them from a peripheral consideration into a cornerstone of global marketing. High-profile athletes, including David Beckham, Cristiano Ronaldo, and Gareth Bale, now strategically license their likenesses to endorse a vast range of products, from sportswear to consumer goods.\n\n\u201cAthletes have recognized the substantial potential in actively developing their image rights,\u201d observes Nigel Currie, a director at brand consultancy Brand Rapport. \u201cFor those who maintain long-term fame, these rights can become a major revenue stream.\u201d Legally, image rights encompass any identifiable attribute linked to an individual, such as a name or signature used on merchandise.\n\nFollowing his record \u00a385 million transfer to Real Madrid in 2013, Gareth Bale assigned 50% of his image rights to the club. The Spanish giant aimed to leverage his global appeal, particularly in Asian markets, to help offset its significant debt through sales of Bale-branded merchandise. Bale also took steps to commercially protect his distinctive \u201cEleven of Hearts\u201d goal celebration gesture, mirroring Ronaldo\u2019s trademarked \u201cCR7\u201d brand.\n\nLegal frameworks protecting these rights have strengthened. A 2004 ruling by UK communications regulator Ofcom established that runner David Bedford could prevent the unauthorized caricature of his image, even without proving direct financial loss. Andy Brown, editor of *World Sports Law Report*, clarifies the distinction in contracts: while standard playing contracts cover team-related obligations, separate image rights agreements govern commercial ventures such as video game avatars or action figures. These rights can extend to trademarked gestures or celebrations, enabling athletes to seek compensation for their use.\n\nThe proliferation of image rights deals in the early 2000s drew scrutiny from tax authorities. Concerns arose that athletes were using separate corporate entities to hold these rights, potentially to avoid income tax by diverting payments. In 2006, HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) initiated investigations into cricket and rugby. Rugby union responded by capping image rights payments at 15% of a player\u2019s total remuneration. Following a case involving Arsenal FC, HMRC and Premier League clubs reportedly reached an understanding: image rights payments would be accepted for tax purposes up to 20% of salary, provided genuine commercial activity underpinned the deals.\n\nA significant legal development occurred in 2012 when Guernsey established the world\u2019s first registrable image right. This allows personalities to formally register attributes like their image, nicknames, or signature mannerisms. Subsequently, revenue generated from these rights can be managed through Guernsey-based companies, offering potential tax advantages. British tennis player Heather Watson is among those who have registered her image there.\n\nDavid Beckham is widely regarded as a pioneer in maximizing image rights revenue. He established Footwork Productions, a company that reportedly generated an annual profit of \u00a315.5 million during his tenure at Real Madrid. His subsequent career moves to LA Galaxy, AC Milan, and Paris Saint-Germain were strategically chosen to enhance his global brand. Notably, during his stint at PSG, Beckham played without a salary\u2014donating it to charity\u2014while still profiting substantially from merchandising and image licensing agreements.\n\n\u201cHe truly optimized the value of those image rights,\u201d notes Andy Brown. As Nigel Currie adds, Beckham\u2019s approach exemplifies how astutely managed image rights can provide athletes with a significant and enduring source of income, long after their playing days have ended.","op1":"refine","op2":"polish","domain":"xsum","model":"ds"}

It is argued that other watermarking techniques are not robust enough to be transferred during model stealing.\n\nOwnership resolution is performed by kind of a membership inference attack that the model owner runs on the potential copy.

Also the attention to important details like query efficiency is taken care of.\n\nIt is bit disappointing that the method is not evaluated on more complex classification problems. In particular, as membership inference (which this method is based on) can be even weaker on those larger and well trained models. The claim about other watermarking techniques no being effective - although probably true - was not substantiated (unless I've missed). at least there is no comparison to other attribution\/provenance techniques.\n\nWhile this submission is a very interesting and enjoyable read, in the end it fails to fully convince how large the impact will be.

{"human":"The expectation of monetary compensation has been associated with poor outcomes in lumbar discectomy, fueling a reluctance among surgeons to treat worker's compensation cases. This issue, however, has not been investigated in patients undergoing cervical disc surgery. This study analyzes the relationship between economic forms of secondary gain and surgical outcome in a group of patients with common pay scales, retirement plans, and disability programs.All procedures were performed at the Portsmouth Naval Medical Center between 1993 and 1995; active duty military servicepersons who were treated for cervical radiculopathy were prospectively included. Clinical, demographic, and financial factors were analyzed to determine which were predictive for outcome. Financial data were used to create a compensation incentive (CI) which is proportional to the rank, years of service, potential disability, retirement eligibility, and base pay and reflects the monetary incentive of disability. The results of cervical surgery were compared to a previously reported companion population of patients treated for lumbar disc disease. A good outcome is defined as a return to active duty, whereas a referral for disability is considered a poor surgical result.One hundred percent follow-up was obtained for 269 patients who were treated with 307 cervical operations. Only 16% (43\/269) of cervical patients received disability, whereas 24.7% (86\/348) of lumbar patients obtained a poor result (p = 0.0082). Although economic forms of secondary gain were not associated with outcome in cervical disease, both the position (p = 0.002) and duration of an individual's military career were significant factors (p = 0.02). Of the medical variables tested, multilevel surgery (p = 0.03) and revision operations at the same level (p = 0.03) were associated with referral for medical discharge.","LLM_1":"Economic secondary gain has been linked to adverse outcomes in lumbar discectomy, contributing to surgeon reluctance in managing workers' compensation cases, yet its role in cervical disc surgery remains unexplored.

{"human":"Soybean proteins are constituents of a number of food products and represent a panel of potential allergens. Thus far, little is known about the molecular characteristics of soybean allergens.The aim of this study was to identify the soybean profilin by PCR-based complementary (c)DNA cloning and to elucidate its allergenic characteristics.Highly degenerate profilin-specific primers were used to identify, by means of PCR, 2 soybean profilin isoforms (GmPRO1 and GmPRO2) by using soybean cDNA as a target. One isoform (GmPRO1) with a length of 394 bp corresponding to 131 amino acid residues was subcloned and expressed in fusion with the maltose-binding protein. Moreover, 3 overlapping recombinant soybean profilin fragments comprising amino acid residues 1-65, 38-88, and 50-131 were also prepared as maltose-binding protein fusion proteins. IgE-binding reactivity of the recombinant proteins and the cross-reactivity of soybean profilin with birch profilin was studied by immunoblotting, enzyme-linked allergosorbent assays (EASTs), and competitive inhibition experiments by using serum samples from 13 soybean-sensitized subjects.Results of immunoblot analysis, EAST, and EAST-inhibition experiments indicate the presence of profilin in soybean extract. The recombinant soybean profilin (rGly m 3) was recognized by IgE in 9 (69%) of the 13 sera tested. Only the full-length rGly m 3 was able to bind with IgE antibodies, whereas the 3 soybean profilin fragments did not show significant binding reactivity, indicating that the IgE binding to rGly m 3 depends on the integrity of a conformational structure, which was not present in the overlapping profilin fragments.

{"human":"The music \u2019 s beat is pounding in both his brain and chest. It seems to be following the beat of his heart. He sat there sipping on his drink, rum and coke, watching her. Everyone seems to be watching her, and who could blame them. The way she was dancing seems to draw everyone in. The short red dress was hugging her body and accentuating her curves as she undulated her hips. Her loose straight black hair was moving as if alive as her body danced to the same beat reverberating through him. As she spun away from him, he saw a tattoo on the small of her back, a praying mantis. \n There were times thought these last two weeks where it seemed to him like she was watching him as much as he was watching her. Sure being in a suit in a bar was odd, but not that odd, He thought. After taking another sip of the drink he had been nursing, he ran his left hand through his hair. It was close to closing time. He would have to make his move soon if he was going to make it tonight. \n Last call was announced by the DJ and he saw her glide off the dance floor with an almost unnatural grace towards the bar. Now would be a perfect opportunity. He reached into the glass that had held his drink and pulled out an ice cube. He let it melt and used the almost ice cold water to wash his hands before standing up with the empty glass and making his way to the women in red. \n The next part was something he had practiced for years before understanding just what needed to be done. He was ready to try again with her. It was something that only amateurs do in public, and he did not view himself as an amateur. His options flashed through his mind as he approached. He could offer to buy her a drink, but that tended to get the worst response. Usually they would accept the drink and then ignore the person who had bought it until they were thirsty again. He had seen that from decades of watching people at different establishments. He could compliment something about her choice of cloths and dismiss her that would draw her attention to him, as he wouldn \u2019 t be doing what the majority of men were doing. Another option was to strike up an interesting conversation with someone near her, preferably on the other side of her to give her the illusion of him talking to her. Then when she joins the conversation make his move. His final option was one he had prepared a week ago, but was one he would not like to resort to, it rankled him as amateurish, and he prided himself as a pro. \n He walks up to the bar and into the only open space, right next to her. Looking around he sees an acquaintance of his, Billy. That would do. He proceeded to greet the acquaintance, as a new idea popped into his head. It would cut into his entertainment funds, but then again after tonight he did not think he would need to utilize his entertainment funds for a while. \n \u201c Hey Sherry \u201d he called to the Bartender. \u201c I \u2019 ve got this final round for everyone tonight. \u201d He tells her as he pulls out a stack of five hundred dollar bills. He never uses credit cards or anything traceable when entertaining himself. \n Her sultry voice purred beside him, \u201c How sweet of you. \u201d it sounds just as sensual as he had imagined it would. He hopes that things worked out where he could hear her voice as she screamed out. \n His smile grew, \u201c Well when you have money burning a hole in your pocket what else are you going to do with it. \u201d He said to bait his line. She didn \u2019 t need to find him attractive necessarily, just intriguing enough to see again in private, or even in a semi public place. It looked like his gamble worked; he saw her checking him out from his peripheral vision. \u201c You going to get some food after this, but before calling it a night? \u201d \n \u201c Oh I can think of a few things I \u2019 d like to eat after dancing up a storm. \u201d She said as her dark eyes devoured him. \u201c Would you like to join me for a meal after we burn a few calories? \u201d then she placed her delicate and recently manicured hand on his shoulder. \n \u201c I would love to. \u201d He said before flashing a genuine smile. Things were going good. Soon they would be in private and he could begin. His recently rented hotel room was under a false name and was paid for in cash. Once in the room he could begin the fun. \n They left the dance bar with her hanging off his arm, and the rest of the men looking on in jealousy. He had seen the same look multiple times as she left the bar with a new man each night. A passing thought entered his head not a single one of the men that left with her had come back to the bar since leaving with her. That thought just passed through idly as another one followed, she would not be coming back to the bar again either. \n The drive was full of sexual tension; she was like a slut, nothing like what he had seen on the dance floor. His play had been correct, she was a gold digger. He pulled up to the hotel and the both of them entered his room on the second floor, 204. As he directed her towards the bed she pulled out of her purse a pair of fuzzy handcuffs. She tried to cuff him still with her sultry and playful smile on her face. He pushed her back and she fell backwards onto the bed after losing her balance. Her legs splayed open as she fell showing him a tease of her black satin underwear. He walked back to the door and locked it with both the key lock and the safety latch. Then he made his way into the bathroom to get his tools. \n \n She giggled on the bed. He wasn \u2019 t just a push over like she thought; this was going to be fun. She reached to her ring and pulled out the metal garret wire and made a small loop. Her other ring had a small hook to catch the loop with. She couldn \u2019 t wait till he came out of the bathroom. \n She wasn \u2019 t prepared for him to come out with a Taser, but her nimbleness and flexibility worked in her favor. She dodged his attack. This wasn \u2019 t how it was supposed to go, she thought. He pulled out a small serrated knife and stalked towards her, keeping between her and the door. In practiced motion she caught the loop with her other ring and then rushed him. He would pay for doing things out of order. The killing was supposed to happen after the sex! Didn \u2019 t he know anything about nature? \n He brought the knife down and she caught it with the wire. Then twisted pulling the knife out of his hand before it could fully cut through her wire. Her dark eyes narrowed and her lips curved into a cruel smile. She leapt at him knocking him back and off balance. He hit his head on the door knob as he went down. \n When next he awoke his hands were secured to the bed frame with the fuzzy handcuffs. And he felt something running along his legs. \u201c You got it all out of order. \u201d She purred at him her dark eyes glaring at him. \u201c We need to have sex before I kill you. Haven \u2019 t you ever heard of praying mantises before? \u201d he felt a thin pressure around his neck as she lightly pulled her hands away from him, the light barely glinting off the garret wire between them. \u201c Now let \u2019 s try this again. \u201d She said as she slid her body up along his. He glanced around and saw his knife on the floor near the bathroom. That option was out. He felt the pressure on his neck again. \u201c Focus on me! \u201d she growled. \n He didn \u2019 t focus on her and each time she noticed that, she would apply more pressure to the garret until he couldn \u2019 t breathe anymore. It was over then. She looked down at him in frustration. It would have been great had he fought at the right time, not the wrong time. She slowly got dressed, and packed up her things. Then went through and got the money he had in his pockets, six hundred would help her when she was out hunting tomorrow night. \n\n","LLM_1":"His eyes locked onto hers, her beat pulsating in sync with his own. Every gaze in that crowded bar seemed drawn to hers. Dancing in an enticing red gown, every curve accentuated by her fluid movements. Loose black locks swayed like alive, entwined with every step, hypnotizing him further. \n\nAs she danced away, his eyes followed the tattoo of an praying insect on a delicate spot. They'd exchanged subtle glances over the past fortnight, like they shared an unspoken understanding. Tonight, closing in, was his chance to act. Last Call echoed through the speakers, drawing her toward the exit. With a flicker of hope, their eyes met once more. Time to move.\n\nHe tossed an icy cube into an emptied glass, letting it dissolve as the bartender announced last call. \"You going for some grub?\" he ventured, making a move toward her with calculated ease. Their gazes enticed each other. Maybe she'd be intrigued enough. When she accepted his invitation, things began to roll in their favor.\n\nAs they left, men watched with envy, accustomed to seeing her leave with another man. Yet none returned to that bar after a departure with their new companions. Not a thought that troubled him for long. Entwining arms, they headed toward his hotel. There, under the guise of casual intimacy, something darker brewed. Little did he realize that this wasn't just another conquest, for she had her own game in store.\n\nWith a seductive smile, handcuffing him with fuzzy cuffs, \"We're doing this the way nature intended.\" The Tazer in hand was the first strike she dodges.

{"human":"The paper works on the problem of few-shot learning. They propose to use contrastive learning to obtain good representations for different mapping functions. Experiments on 1-D, 2-D image and scene representation show certain advantages.\n\n[Strengths]\n- The idea of using contrastive learning to obtain good representations for different mapping functions is interesting and novel.\n- The writing is in general clear and there are also a lot of experimental results.\n\n[Weakness]\n- There is a strong assumption that the mapping function during the few-shot task is one of the functions during training. Is this practical?\n- The contrast learning only encourages those function representations to be different and it might not be able to learn the underlying function characteristics. Why can it help during down-stream few-shot tasks? In other words, I could use one-hot vector to represent each function. I could give the function index to the down-stream task. Is it helpful?\n- Although contrast learning is hot, why must use contrast learning to learn function representation? You know the function labels, so you could also use triplet loss during the representation learning.\n- Although the authors consider quite a few downstream tasks, all the comparisons are quite preliminary. It would be more convincing to show that in at least one task your approach can outperform SOTA or your function representation can improve SOTA.\n- Figure 3(a) shows a better result with 50 shots, but with 200 shots. Why? \n- There is no explanation for Fig. 2(b). It seems you use N samples to identify the function and the rest N-M samples to train the decoder. Is it correct? What's a good N here? What is the \"S\" operation?\n- Eq. (4) does not look correct.\n- Is Section 3.1 complete or not ? The organization is a bit wired.\n\n---\nUpdate:\n- I think the idea of this paper is very interesting. The authors' responses also address most of my concerns. The remaining issues are: 1) the writing needs to be improved to make the paper easy to read; 2) I am still not so convinced with the experiments. It would be more convincing if the authors can demonstrate this on few-shot image classification to improve SOTA, for which the joint (x,y) distribution might be too big at the image level.

Experimental results on various tasks show some advantages. However, several concerns arise.\n\nOne major assumption is that mapping during few shot task aligns with training functions; is this assumption practical? The method only differentiates function represenations but does this enable learning underlying characteristics? Can it benefit downstream fewshot tasks if onehot vectors are used instead? Why is contrast  loss preferred over triplet  for learning function reps? \n\nAlthough contrast is popular, what's the necessity of applying it for function  rep? Given function indices, can one use standard triplet or one hot vector? Preliminary comparisons across tasks are presented; it would strengthen the approach if it outperformed SOTAs or improved existing rep in one downstream task.\n\nFig   shows better results with fewer shots; however, this is counterintuitive.

While experimental results demonstrate some benefits, I do have several reservations.\n\nSpecifically, one assumption that underlies the method is the alignment of mapping functions during the few-shots task with the training objectives. I am unsure if such an assumption holds in practice. Moreover, by differentiating function representations, does the proposed method enable the learning of underlying task characteristics, or can it leverage downstream tasks more effectively when using one-hot vectors instead?\n\nFurthermore, why is it that contrastive loss is chosen over the more traditional triplet loss for representation learning? Although contrast loss might be popular in some contexts, its necessity for this particular application remains unclear. Given the function index information, could standard triplets or even one-shot vectors be used as alternatives?\n\nAdditionally, preliminary comparisons to state-of-the-art methods or improvements over existing representations in downstream domains would significantly strengthen this approach. In this regard, Fig.  appears to show improved results at lower shot counts, albeit somewhat counter-intuitively. Could you provide further clarification on the \"N\" sample size and the's' operation used in Fig.? Also Eq. seems to contain an error, as does Section. Reorganization of this section would be beneficial.\n\nAlthough you have addressed some key issues, further clarifying the writing, experiments \u2013 particularly those related to image classification, joint distributions, \u2013 and possibly standardizing some methods may enhance the paper's readability and persuasiveness.

{"human":"An argument for idealism, such as those of Hegel and Berkeley, is ipso facto an argument against materialism. Matter can be argued to be redundant, as in bundle theory, and mind-independent properties can in turn be reduced to subjective percepts. Berkeley presents an example of the latter by pointing out that it is impossible to gather direct evidence of matter, as there is no direct experience of matter; all that is experienced is perception, whether internal or external. As such, the existence of matter can only be assumed from the apparent (perceived) stability of perceptions; it finds absolutely no evidence in direct experience.","LLM_1":"An argument for idealism, as advanced by philosophers like Hegel and Berkeley, inherently opposes materialism. Matter may be considered ontologically redundant, as suggested by bundle theory, and mind-independent properties can be reduced to subjective perceptions. Berkeley illustrates this by noting that direct evidence for matter is unattainable, since all experience consists solely of perception\u2014internal or external. Consequently, the existence of matter can only be inferred from the apparent stability of perceptions, with no basis in direct experience.","LLM_2":"**Philosophers Challenge Materialism, Argue Reality May Be Rooted in Mind, Not Matter**\n\nIn a longstanding philosophical debate over the nature of reality, thinkers like George Berkeley and G.W.F. Hegel have advanced a bold alternative to materialism: idealism\u2014the view that reality is fundamentally mental or immaterial.\n\nAt the heart of this argument is a simple but provocative claim: matter, as an independent substance, may not exist at all. Instead, what we perceive as the physical world could be nothing more than a collection of experiences and perceptions. This perspective gains support from \"bundle theory,\" which suggests objects are merely bundles of properties or qualities\u2014with no underlying material substance holding them together.\n\nBerkeley, an 18th-century Irish philosopher, famously contended that we never directly observe matter. All human experience, he argued, consists entirely of perceptions\u2014sights, sounds, sensations\u2014none of which provide direct evidence for a mind-independent material world. If we can\u2019t perceive matter itself, only our perceptions of it, then asserting its existence becomes an assumption, not a fact.\n\nAccording to idealists, the apparent consistency of our experiences\u2014why objects seem stable and predictable\u2014is often cited as proof of an external material world. But Berkeley counters that such regularity doesn't require matter; it could instead reflect the structured nature of perception itself, possibly grounded in a divine or universal consciousness.\n\nThe implications are profound: if idealism holds, then the foundation of reality isn\u2019t atoms or particles, but mind. While modern science leans heavily on materialist assumptions, these philosophical challenges continue to prompt debate about what we can truly know\u2014and what might lie beyond the veil of perception.","op1":"refine","op2":"rewrite","domain":"squad","model":"Qwen"}
